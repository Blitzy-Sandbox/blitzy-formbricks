## Quick Comparison

| Feature | Link Surveys | Website & App Surveys |
|---------|--------------|----------------------|
| **Best for** | Known touchpoints | Behavior-based intercepts |
| **SDK required** | No | Yes |
| **Distribution channels** | Email, SMS, push, webview | In-app modal/slide-in triggered by SDK |
| **Targeting** | External (you decide) | Built-in attribute-based segments |
| **Survey fatigue prevention** | Manual (external) | Automatic (built-in cooldown) |
| **User identification** | [Personal Links](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/personal-links) | [SDK user attributes](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/user-identification) |
| **Single-use links** | Supported | N/A |
| **PIN protection** | Supported | N/A |

## Link Surveys

Also known as **invitation-based surveys**. No SDK needed. You control when and who receives the survey, often through CRMs, marketing tools, or similar platforms.

### Delivery Channels

Formbricks supports four distribution channels. Link Surveys cover three of them directly:

- **Link** — Standalone URL shared via any medium
- **Email** — Embedded survey or clickable link sent in transactional or marketing emails
- **Website** — Embedded on a website via iframe or popup
- **In-app** — Displayed inside a mobile or desktop app via webview embed


### URL Features

- **[Hidden Fields](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/hidden-fields)**: Pass user ID, order ID, or any identifier
- **[Data prefilling](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/data-prefilling)**: Pre-populate answers and optionally skip prefilled questions
- **[Personal Links](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/personal-links)**: Generate unique survey links for individual contacts

### Additional Link Survey Capabilities

- **[Single-Use Links](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/single-use-links)**: Generate one-time tokens that invalidate after submission
- **[PIN Protection](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/pin-protected-surveys)**: Require a PIN to access the survey
- **[Email Verification](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/verify-email-before-survey)**: Verify respondent email before allowing access
- **[Source Tracking](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/source-tracking)**: Track where respondents come from via URL parameters
- **[Start At Question](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/start-at-question)**: Deep-link to a specific question in the survey
- **[Custom Head Scripts](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/custom-head-scripts)**: Inject custom scripts into the survey page

### Webview With Embed Mode

For mobile apps, you can display Link Surveys in a webview with full control over when the survey appears. Your app decides the timing—open the webview when the moment is right.

**Enable Embed mode** by appending `?embed=true` to the survey URL:

```text
https://app.formbricks.com/s/<surveyId>?embed=true&userId=123
```

**Listen for events** to close the webview automatically:

```javascript
window.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  if (event.data === "formbricksSurveyCompleted") {
    closeWebView();
  }
});
```

This approach gives you full control:
- **When**: Your app opens the webview at the right moment (after purchase, case closed, etc.)
- **Who**: Personal links allow you to have unique links for identified contacts.
- **Display**: Survey renders inside your app
- **Dismissal**: Close the webview on completion or user exit

Learn more in the [Embed Surveys guide](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/embed-surveys).

<Note>
  Link Surveys are also the recommended approach for **email distribution**. Embed a survey link in your transactional or marketing emails to collect feedback at key moments such as post-purchase, onboarding completion, or support ticket resolution.
</Note>

### When To Use

- You already decide externally who should receive which survey
- Survey timing is tied to a known event such as a click on a link or button and in **each case**, you want to show the survey
- You want fastest approach to production
- Your platform doesn't have a supported SDK
- You don't need Formbricks attribute-based targeting & survey fatigue controls


## Website & App Surveys (SDK)

Also known as **intercept surveys**. Requires SDK integration. Formbricks handles targeting, triggering, and survey fatigue.

![In-app survey example](/images/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/link-surveys-vs-in-app-surveys/in-app-surveys.webp)

### In-App Features

**[Action tracking](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/actions)**

Track in-app events and trigger surveys based on them:

```javascript
formbricks.track("action_name");
```

**Built-in survey cooldown**

- Global waiting time (e.g., show max 1 survey every 7 days per user)
- Per-survey overrides for high-priority surveys

**[Segment-based targeting](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/advanced-targeting)**

Target surveys based on user attributes (plan type, language, feature flags).

**In-app display**

Surveys appear inside your app as modals or slide-ins.

### When To Use

- You want Formbricks to handle who sees which survey
- Surveys should trigger based on user behavior (page views, clicks, custom events)
- You want automatic survey fatigue prevention
- You need percentage-based sampling (e.g., show to 10% of users)

## Decision Guide

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do you control survey triggering externally?">
    Use **Link-based Surveys**. Send the URL when the moment is right, even for in-app surveys. Pass context via Hidden Fields.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Should surveys trigger based on in-app behavior?">
    Use **Website & App Surveys**. The SDK tracks actions and triggers surveys automatically.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you want automatic survey fatigue prevention?">
    Use **Website & App Surveys**. Built-in cooldown prevents over-surveying.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do you need email survey distribution?">
    Use **Link Surveys**. Embed a survey link or inline preview in your emails. Combine with Personal Links to identify respondents and Hidden Fields to pass contextual data.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Need the fastest path to production?">
    Start with **Link Surveys**. No SDK integration needed. Add SDK later if you need behavior-based triggers.
  </Accordion>
