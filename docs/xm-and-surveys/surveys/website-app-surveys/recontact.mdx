## When Do Recontact Options Come Into Play?

Recontact options are the last layer of the logic that determines if a survey is shown to the current user. The logic goes as follows:

1. Targeting: Does the current user targeted to fill out this survey? If yes...

2. Trigger: Is the survey triggered? If yes...

3. **Recontact Options:** Should the survey be shown (again) to this user? That's dependent on:

- Did the user see any survey recently (meaning, has Survey Cooldown passed)?

- Did the user see this specific survey already?

- How many times did the user see this specific survey already?

- Has the user already responded to this survey?

As you can see, there are a lot of different cases to cover. Let's have a closer look 👇

## Recontact Options

<Note>By default, a survey is shown to each user only once.</Note>

You can adjust the default behavior by modifying the Recontact Options for each survey in the settings:

1. Open the Survey Editor for the survey you want to see & modify the Recontact Options for.

2. Select the Settings Tab.

3. Ensure your Survey type is set to **App Survey**.

1. Scroll down to the Recontact Options section.

Available Recontact Options include:

- **Show only once**: (default) Displays the survey a single time, regardless of whether it was completed.

- **Show Multiple Times**: Displays the survey up to a specified number of times. You can set a maximum display count (e.g., show the survey a maximum of 3 times). The survey stops appearing once the user submits a response or the display limit is reached.

- **Until they Submit a Response**: If targeting matches and trigger fires, Formbricks keeps showing the survey until the user submits a response.

- **Keep Showing while Conditions Match**: Always shows the survey while specific conditions are met. Useful for continuous feedback collection, such as in [Docs Feedback Survey](/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/docs-feedback) or the [Feedback Box](/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/feedback-box).

## Project-wide Survey Cooldown

The Survey Cooldown is a universal blocker to make sure that no user sees too many surveys. This is particularly helpful when several teams of large organizations use Formbricks at the same time.

<Note>The default Survey Cooldown is set to 7 days.</Note>

To adjust the Survey Cooldown:

1. Visit Formbricks Settings

2. Go to Project Settings

3. Find the **Recontact Waiting Time** section

4. Modify the interval (in days) as needed.

## Overriding Survey Cooldown for a Specific Survey

For specific surveys, you may need to override the default cooldown. Below is how you can do that:

1. In the Survey Editor, access the Settings Tab.

2. Find the Ignore Waiting Time between Surveys toggle under Recontact Options.

3. Enable this toggle to bypass the global setting.

4. Set a custom recontact period:

   - **Always Show Survey**: Displays the survey whenever triggered, ignoring the cooldown.

   - **Wait `X` days before showing this survey again**: Sets a specific interval before the survey can be shown again.

## Configuration Reference

Under the hood, the recontact behavior is controlled by several configuration properties in the Formbricks SDK. These properties are set automatically based on your selections in the Survey Editor:

| UI Option | SDK Property (`displayOption`) | Additional Properties | Behavior |
|-----------|-------------------------------|----------------------|----------|
| Show Only Once | `displayOnce` | — | Survey is displayed once, regardless of whether the user completes it |
| Show Multiple Times | `displaySome` | `displayLimit` (number) | Survey is shown up to the specified limit; stops if the user responds |
| Until They Submit a Response | `displayMultiple` | — | Survey keeps appearing until the user submits a response |
| Keep Showing While Conditions Match | `respondMultiple` | — | Survey is always shown when targeting and trigger conditions are met |

The waiting period between survey displays is controlled by:

| Property | Level | Description |
|----------|-------|-------------|
| `recontactDays` | Project | Default cooldown between any two surveys for the same user (default: 7 days) |
| `recontactDays` | Survey | Survey-specific override for the cooldown period; takes precedence over the project-level setting |

{/* Source: packages/js-core/src/types/config.ts — TEnvironmentStateSurvey (recontactDays, displayLimit, displayOption), TEnvironmentStateProject (recontactDays) */}
{/* Source: packages/js-core/src/lib/common/utils.ts — filterSurveys() evaluates recontact logic */}
