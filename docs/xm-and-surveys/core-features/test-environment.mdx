description: "Each project on Formbricks has two environments: a test environment and a production environment. The test environment is used to test your surveys through before they are sent out to your customers."
---

To clearly separate between test and production data, Formbricks provides two different environments for each project. These environments are completely independent of each other **incl. API keys, project configuration, and environment IDs** used for connecting Formbricks to run in-product surveys. This architecture supports safe testing before deploying surveys to production — each environment has its own unique environment ID used for SDK connections, and all survey data (responses, contacts) are completely separated between environments.

## Toggle Between Environments

You can switch between environments from the Website & App Connection settings (Configuration > Website & App Connection). At the top, you'll see a toggle button that says "Switch to development" (when in production) or "Switch to production" (when in development).

<Note>
  Switching environments changes the visible surveys, responses, and API keys. Each environment has its own
  unique environment ID needed for SDK integration. Make sure you are using the correct environment ID when
  connecting the Formbricks SDK to your application.
</Note>

### Dev Environment (Testing)

The development environment is used to test your surveys and project configuration before deploying to production. When you're in development mode, you'll see a dark red breadcrumb labeled "development" at the top.

<Warning>
  Responses collected in the development environment are completely separate from production and cannot be
  merged. Use the development environment exclusively for testing purposes.
</Warning>

### Production Environment

The production environment is used to serve your surveys to your respondents.

## Copy Surveys Between Environments

<Steps>
  <Step title="Click More Actions">
    Click on the "More actions" button of a survey in the survey list

    ![More actions](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/test-environment/more-actions.webp)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Target Environment">
    Choose which environment you want to copy the survey to

    ![Copy survey](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/test-environment/modal.webp)
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Copied surveys do not carry over their response data — only the survey configuration is duplicated.
  Specifically, the following **is copied**: survey questions, conditional logic, and styling settings. The
  following **is not copied**: responses, contacts, and integration connections.
</Note>

## Environment-Specific Configuration

Each environment maintains its own independent configuration. Understanding what is environment-specific helps you set up both environments correctly:

- **API Keys**: Each environment has unique API keys. Use the development API key for testing and the production API key for your live application.
- **Environment IDs**: Development and production environments have different environment IDs. Ensure you pass the correct environment ID when initializing the [Formbricks SDK](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/quickstart).
- **Webhook Configurations**: [Webhooks](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/webhooks) are configured per environment. Set up separate webhooks for development and production as needed.
- **Integration Connections**: Native integrations (such as [Slack](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/slack), [Google Sheets](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/google-sheets), [Notion](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/notion), and [Airtable](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/airtable)) may need to be configured separately for each environment.

## Best Practices

Follow these guidelines to make the most of the dual-environment setup:

- **Test before publishing**: Always test your surveys in the development environment before publishing them to production. This helps catch issues with question flow, conditional logic, and styling.
- **SDK integration testing**: Use the development environment when integrating the Formbricks SDK into your application. Switch to the production environment ID only after verifying that surveys display and behave correctly.
- **Verify conditional logic**: Test all conditional logic branches and question branching paths in the development environment to ensure respondents see the correct questions based on their answers.
- **Validate integrations**: Configure and test [webhook](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/webhooks) and [native integration](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/overview) connections in the development environment before replicating the setup in production.
- **Keep environments in sync**: When making changes to survey design or project configuration, remember to copy or replicate those changes to the other environment as needed.
