## Additional Information

### Request Body Fields

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `data` | `object` | No | Response answers keyed by question ID (e.g., `{"clx1234abc": "answer value"}`) |
| `finished` | `boolean` | No | Set to `true` to mark the response as complete. Set to `false` for partial submissions |
| `endingId` | `string` | No | The ID of the ending card shown to the respondent |
| `language` | `string` | No | Language/locale code for multi-language surveys (e.g., `"en"`, `"de"`, `"pt"`) |
| `variables` | `object` | No | Survey variables as key-value pairs |
| `ttc` | `object` | No | Time-to-completion data per question (question ID → milliseconds) |

<Note>
  Once a response has `finished: true`, it cannot be updated further. Any attempt to update a finished response will return a `400 Bad Request` error.
</Note>

### Partial Submissions

To capture partial responses before the survey is completed, create the response with `finished: false` and then update it incrementally as the user progresses through questions:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "clx1234abc": "New answer for this question"
  },
  "finished": false
}
```

When the respondent reaches the end of the survey, send a final update with `finished: true`:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "clx9876xyz": "Final question answer"
  },
  "finished": true,
  "endingId": "ending_card_id"
}
```
