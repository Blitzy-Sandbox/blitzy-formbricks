Two-factor authentication (2FA) adds an extra layer of security to user accounts by requiring a second form of verification in addition to the password. This significantly reduces the risk of unauthorized access even if passwords are compromised.

<Note>
  Two-factor authentication is an Enterprise Edition feature. Visit the [license management](/self-hosting/advanced/license) page for details.
</Note>


## Prerequisites

To use two-factor authentication, users must:

- Have an account with email-based authentication (third-party login providers like Google SSO are not compatible with 2FA)
- Have a TOTP-compatible authenticator app installed on their device (such as Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, or 1Password)

## Setting Up Two-Factor Authentication

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate To Account Settings">
    Go to **Profile Settings** via the menu in the lower right corner, then navigate to the **Security** section.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enable Two-Factor Authentication">
    Toggle the **Two-factor authentication** switch to begin the setup wizard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Your Password">
    Enter your current password to verify your identity. This step prevents unauthorized 2FA changes.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Scan QR Code With Authenticator App">
    Use your authenticator app (Google Authenticator, Authy, Microsoft Authenticator, or similar TOTP-compatible app) to scan the displayed QR code.

    **Manual Secret Entry:** If you cannot scan the QR code, click the copy button next to the displayed secret key and manually enter it into your authenticator app.

    Source: `apps/web/modules/ee/two-factor-auth/components/scan-qr-code.tsx`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Verification Code">
    Enter the 6-digit TOTP code from your authenticator app to verify the setup was successful.

    Source: `apps/web/modules/ee/two-factor-auth/components/enter-code.tsx`
  </Step>
  <Step title="Save Backup Codes">
    After verification, backup codes are generated and displayed. You can **copy** them to your clipboard or **download** them as a `formbricks-backup-codes.txt` file.

    Each backup code is formatted as `XXXXX-XXXXX` (10 characters with a hyphen separator). Each code can only be used once.

    Source: `apps/web/modules/ee/two-factor-auth/components/display-backup-codes.tsx`
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Store your backup codes in a secure location. They cannot be viewed again after closing the setup dialog. If you lose access to both your authenticator device and backup codes, you will need administrator assistance to regain access to your account.
</Warning>

## Logging In With Two-Factor Authentication

Once 2FA is enabled, the login process requires an additional step:

1. Enter your email and password as usual
2. When prompted, enter either:
   - A 6-digit TOTP code from your authenticator app, or
   - One of your backup codes in `XXXXX-XXXXX` format or as the raw 10-character code

## Backup Code Usage For Account Recovery

If your authenticator app is unavailable (for example, a lost or replaced device), backup codes serve as an alternative method to access your account:

1. During login, when prompted for the TOTP code, switch to backup code entry
2. Enter one of the saved backup codes in `XXXXX-XXXXX` format
3. Each backup code is single-use — once used, it cannot be used again
4. If all backup codes are exhausted, contact an organization administrator for assistance

## Managing Two-Factor Authentication

### Disabling 2FA

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate To Security Settings">
    Go to **Profile Settings > Security**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Toggle Off Two-Factor Authentication">
    Toggle off the **Two-factor authentication** switch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Confirm Disabling">
    In the confirmation dialog, enter:
    - Your current password, AND
    - Either a 6-digit TOTP code from your authenticator app, OR a backup code

    You can switch between TOTP code and backup code entry using the "Lost access?" link.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Source: `apps/web/modules/ee/two-factor-auth/components/disable-two-factor-modal.tsx`

<Note>
  When 2FA is disabled, all associated backup codes are permanently deleted for security reasons.
</Note>

### Re-Enabling 2FA

If you need to set up 2FA again (for example, after getting a new device):

1. Follow the same setup process described above — the entire flow repeats: confirm password → scan QR code → enter verification code → save backup codes
2. New backup codes will be generated
3. Old backup codes (if any existed) will be invalidated
