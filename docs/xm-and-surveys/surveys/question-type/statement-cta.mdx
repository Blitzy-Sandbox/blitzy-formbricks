The Statement / CTA card consists of a title (a question or short note) and an optional description, which can be a brief note (related to the CTA) or guideline. Instead of collecting input, this type includes a call-to-action button for further steps, such as booking an interview call, redirecting to a website, or simply advancing the respondent to the next question.

## Elements

![Overview of Statement question type](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/question-type/statement-cta.webp)

### Title

The main heading that appears at the top of the card. This maps to the `headline` field in the survey schema and supports internationalization (I18n) for multi-language surveys.

### Description

An optional descriptive text displayed below the title, typically used to provide context, instructions, or additional information for the next step. This maps to the `subheader` field in the schema and supports rich text content with internationalized values.

## Button Options

The CTA card supports two distinct button modes controlled by the `buttonExternal` field:

### Continue In Survey (Default)

When `buttonExternal` is set to `false` (the default), the CTA button advances the respondent to the next question or card in the survey. No external URL is needed in this mode — the button simply acts as a navigation control within the survey flow.

### Redirect To External URL

When `buttonExternal` is set to `true`, the CTA button redirects the respondent to an external URL. In this mode:

- The `buttonUrl` field must contain a valid URL
- Clicking the CTA button opens the external URL in a new browser tab
- Both `buttonUrl` and a button label are required when this mode is enabled

<Note>When using an external redirect, the exact behavior (new tab vs. same window) may vary depending on the survey embed context. In the default survey renderer, external URLs open in a new tab.</Note>

### CTA Button Label

The `ctaButtonLabel` field controls the text displayed on the primary CTA button (for example, "Continue", "Learn More", or "Visit Website"). This field supports internationalization, so you can provide different button labels for each language in a multi-language survey.

### Dismiss Button

The dismiss button provides a secondary option that allows respondents to skip the CTA and proceed to the next question without clicking the primary CTA button. When a dismiss button label is configured:

- A secondary button appears alongside the primary CTA button
- Clicking the dismiss button skips the CTA action and moves to the next question
- This is useful for non-mandatory CTAs where users should have the option to skip

If no dismiss button label is set, only the primary CTA button is shown on the card.

<Note>The dismiss button is particularly helpful when you want to offer a call to action (such as "Book a Demo") but do not want to force every respondent to interact with it. Users who are not interested can simply dismiss and continue with the survey.</Note>

## Redirect URL Configuration

The redirect behavior is determined by the combination of `buttonExternal` and `buttonUrl`:

| Setting | `buttonExternal` | `buttonUrl` | Behavior |
|---------|-------------------|-------------|----------|
| Continue in survey | `false` (default) | Not required | Advances to next question |
| Redirect to URL | `true` | Valid URL required | Opens external URL in new tab |

<Warning>When `buttonExternal` is enabled, a valid URL and a CTA button label are both required. The survey editor will validate that these fields are filled before allowing the survey to be published.</Warning>

## No Validation Rules

Unlike data-collection question types (such as free text or multiple choice), the Statement / CTA element does **not** have a `validation` field in the schema. It is a statement or action card — it does not collect respondent input data and therefore does not support input validation rules.

<Note>Since the CTA element does not collect data, it always records a value of `"clicked"` when the respondent interacts with the primary CTA button. This can be used in conditional logic to determine whether the respondent engaged with the CTA.</Note>
