Team-level roles provide granular project permissions beyond organization roles, enabling fine-grained access control within specific teams and projects. These roles work alongside organization-level roles to create a flexible, two-tier permission system.

<Note>
  Team-based access control is an Enterprise Edition feature. Upgrade to the Enterprise plan to enable teams and granular project permissions. Visit the [license management](/self-hosting/advanced/license) page for details.

## Understanding The Role Hierarchy

Formbricks uses a two-tier permission system:

1. **Organization-level roles** — Apply across all teams and projects (see [Organizations and Roles](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/user-management/organizations-and-roles))
2. **Team-level roles** — Apply within specific teams and their assigned projects

### How Roles Interact

- Organization-level roles (Owner, Manager) can override team-level restrictions
- Organization Owners and Managers have implicit access to all teams and projects without being members
- Team-level roles provide granular control for specific teams
- Project permissions further refine what users can do within individual projects

## Team-Level Roles

Each team member is assigned one of two roles: **Admin** or **Contributor**. These roles determine what a user can do within the team itself.

<!-- Source: apps/web/modules/ee/teams/lib/roles.ts — ZTeamRole = z.enum(["admin", "contributor"]) -->

### Admin

- Full team management permissions
- Can add and remove team members
- Can assign projects to the team
- Can manage team settings (name, membership)
- These permissions are scoped to the team where the user holds the Admin role and do not carry over to other teams

### Contributor

- Access to team projects based on the project permission level assigned to the team
- Can create and manage surveys within team projects (when the team has Read & Write or Manage permission)
- Cannot manage team membership or settings
- Permission scope is defined by the project-level assignment (Read, Read & Write, Manage)

### Team Role Comparison

| Permission | Admin | Contributor |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| View Team Projects | ✅ | ✅ |
| Create Surveys in Team Projects | ✅ | ✅ |
| Add Team Members | ✅ | ❌ |
| Remove Team Members | ✅ | ❌ |
| Assign Projects to Team | ✅ | ❌ |
| Manage Team Settings | ✅ | ❌ |

## Project-Level Permissions

Within each project, team members can have one of three permission levels. These permissions are assigned when a project is linked to a team.

<!-- Source: apps/web/modules/ee/teams/project-teams/types/team.ts — ZTeamPermission = z.enum(["read", "readWrite", "manage"]) -->

### Read

- Read access to all resources (except settings) in the project
- Can view surveys, responses, and analytics
- Cannot create, edit, or delete surveys
- Cannot modify project settings

### Read & Write

- Read and write access to all resources (except settings) in the project
- Can create, edit, and delete surveys
- Can manage responses and tags
- Can download survey data
- Cannot modify project settings or manage integrations

### Manage

- Full project control including settings
- Can manage API keys and integrations
- Can configure project-level settings (recontact options, styling, survey languages)
- Can manage project tags and actions

## Team Creation Process

To create a new team in your organization:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Organization Settings">
    Navigate to **Organization Settings > Teams** in the Formbricks dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Create A New Team">
    Click **Create Team** and provide a name for the team.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Members">
    Add members from your organization. Only existing organization members can be added to teams.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Team Roles">
    Assign each member a team role — **Admin** or **Contributor**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign Projects">
    Link projects to the team and set the permission level for each project: **Read**, **Read & Write**, or **Manage**.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Member Assignment

Team membership is managed by Team Admins and organization-level Owners or Managers:

- Only existing organization members can be added to teams — invite users to the organization first via [Invite Members](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/user-management/invite-members)
- **Team Admins** can add and remove members from their own team
- **Organization Owners and Managers** can manage membership of any team, even without being a member
- Each team member is assigned a team role: **Admin** or **Contributor**
- A user can belong to multiple teams simultaneously with different roles in each

<!-- Source: apps/web/modules/ee/teams/team-list/components/team-settings/member-row.tsx -->

## Project Access Scoping

Teams control which projects are visible to their members and what level of access those members have:

- Each team-project assignment carries a permission level: **Read**, **Read & Write**, or **Manage**
- Team members can only access projects that are explicitly assigned to their team
- If a user belongs to multiple teams that are assigned the same project with different permission levels, the **highest permission takes precedence**
- Organization Owners and Managers bypass team-based scoping and have implicit access to all projects

<!-- Source: apps/web/modules/ee/teams/lib/roles.ts — getProjectPermissionByUserId iterates all project memberships and returns the highest permission -->
<!-- Source: apps/web/modules/ee/teams/project-teams/types/team.ts — ZProjectTeam type -->
