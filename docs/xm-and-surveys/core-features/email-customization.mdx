  **Self-Hosting Requirements**: Uploading custom organization logos for emails requires file upload storage
  to be configured. If you're self-hosting Formbricks, make sure to [configure file
  uploads](/self-hosting/configuration/file-uploads) before using this feature.

Email branding is a white-label feature that allows you to customize the email that is sent to your users. You can upload a logo of your company and use it in the email.

<Note>Only the Owner and Managers of the organization can modify the logo.</Note>

## How to Upload a Logo

1. Go to the Organization Settings page.
2. You will see a card called **Email Customization** under the **General** section.

## Use Cases

- **White-Labeling**: Customize all outgoing emails with your organization logo and branding to remove default Formbricks branding from respondent-facing communications.
- **Branding**: Add your company logo to every email sent by Formbricks, reinforcing brand recognition with survey respondents and team members.
- **Survey Distribution**: Send branded link surveys directly to contacts via email, ensuring recipients see your organization identity throughout the survey experience.
- **Notification Emails**: Response completion notifications sent to your team carry your organization branding for a professional, cohesive look.
- **Invitation Emails**: Brand member invitation emails with your organization logo so new team members recognize your organization immediately.
- **Follow-Up Emails**: Automated post-response follow-up emails include your branding for a consistent experience.

<Note>Follow-up emails are part of the Formbricks [Enterprise Edition](/self-hosting/advanced/license). An active enterprise license is required to use email follow-ups.</Note>

## Transactional Email Types

Formbricks sends several categories of transactional emails, all of which adopt the branded email template when a custom logo is configured. The following table lists all email types organized by category:

| Email Category | Email Type | Description |
|----------------|------------|-------------|
| Authentication | Forgot Password | Sent when a user requests a password reset link |
| Authentication | Email Verification | Sent to verify a new user's email address during signup |
| Authentication | Password Reset Notification | Notifies the user after their password has been successfully changed |
| Authentication | New Email Verification | Sent to verify an updated email address when a user changes their email |
| Invitations | Invite Email | Organization membership invitation sent to new team members |
| Invitations | Invite Accepted | Notification sent to the inviter when an invitation is accepted |
| Survey | Link Survey Email | Email distribution of link surveys directly to contacts |
| Survey | Follow-Up Email | Post-response follow-up emails triggered automatically (Enterprise Edition) |
| Survey | Response Finished | Notification sent when a survey response is completed |
| Preview | Email Customization Preview | Preview email used to test the branded email template |
| Preview | Embed Survey Preview | Preview of an embedded survey rendered within an email |

## Legal Footer Configuration

All transactional emails sent by Formbricks include a legal footer section for regulatory compliance. The email template supports configurable legal properties that self-hosted instances should set to comply with email regulations such as CAN-SPAM and GDPR.

The email template wrapper accepts the following legal configuration properties:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `privacyUrl` | URL to your organization's privacy policy page |
| `imprintUrl` | URL to your organization's imprint or legal notice page |
| `imprintAddress` | Physical mailing address displayed in the email footer |

The footer is rendered by `packages/email/src/components/email-footer.tsx` and the legal links are rendered within the shared template at `packages/email/src/components/email-template.tsx`. Footer text is translatable via the internationalization system using translation keys such as `emails.email_footer_text_1` and `emails.email_footer_text_2`.

<Note>
  **Compliance Requirement**: If you are self-hosting Formbricks, ensure your email footer includes a valid physical mailing address and links to your privacy policy and imprint pages. These are required by email regulations including CAN-SPAM (United States) and GDPR (European Union).
</Note>

## Email Template Components

Formbricks uses a set of shared React Email components to ensure consistent styling and branding across all transactional emails. All email types use the shared `EmailTemplate` wrapper for a unified layout.

| Component | File | Purpose |
|-----------|------|---------|
| Email Template | `email-template.tsx` | Shared wrapper that renders the branded layout including logo, content area, and legal footer for every email |
| Email Button | `email-button.tsx` | Call-to-action button component used in emails for actions such as verifying an email or resetting a password |
| Email Element Header | `email-element-header.tsx` | Section header component for rendering question headlines and subheaders in embedded survey emails |
| Email Footer | `email-footer.tsx` | Footer component that renders translatable legal compliance text at the bottom of every email |

Source: `packages/email/src/components/`

When a custom organization logo is uploaded, the `EmailTemplate` wrapper replaces the default Formbricks logo with your organization's logo across all email types. The template also renders imprint and privacy policy links in the footer section when configured.
