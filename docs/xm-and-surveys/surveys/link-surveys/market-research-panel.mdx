<Note>
  Prolific is a paid service. You need to fund your account to access the pool
  of participants. The cost depends on the number of participants you want to
  reach and the demographics you're targeting. You can get an estimate of the
  cost with the [Prolific price calculator](https://www.prolific.com/calculator)
</Note>

## Purpose

External research panels are useful when:

- You don't have access to enough people who match your target audience
- You want to reach a specific demographic
- You want to reach a large number of people quickly

## How It Works

The integration between Formbricks and Prolific follows a straightforward respondent routing flow:

1. **Prolific sends participants** to your Formbricks survey URL with hidden field parameters (`PROLIFIC_PID`, `STUDY_ID`, `SESSION_ID`) appended as URL query parameters
2. **Participants complete the survey** in Formbricks, and the hidden field values are automatically captured with each response
3. **Formbricks redirects participants** back to Prolific using the configured redirect URL after survey completion
4. **Prolific marks the submission as complete** and compensates the participant accordingly

<Note>
  The `PROLIFIC_PID` hidden field is the key identifier that links each Formbricks response to a specific Prolific participant. This enables you to match survey data with participant demographics in Prolific's dashboard for comprehensive research analysis.

## Setup Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add Hidden Fields To The Formbricks Survey">
    To be able to attribute a completed answer to a research participant, you need to add hidden fields to your Formbricks survey. To do so, edit your survey and scroll down to the Hidden Fields card.

    Add three fields with the IDs `PROLIFIC_PID`, `STUDY_ID`, and `SESSION_ID`.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Create An Account On Prolific">
    Go to [Prolific](https://app.prolific.co/) and create an account.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create A Study On Prolific">
    Once you're logged in to Prolific, create a new study.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy The Formbricks Survey Link To The Prolific Study">
    Connect the Formbricks survey with the Prolific study by copying the survey link from Formbricks and pasting it into the Prolific study:

  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose URL Parameters For Attribution">
    To attribute responses to the correct participant, you need to add URL parameters to the Formbricks survey link. The parameters are `PROLIFIC_PID`, `STUDY_ID`, and `SESSION_ID`, exactly like the hidden fields you added.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Update The Formbricks Redirect URL">
    To ensure that participants are redirected back to Prolific after completing the survey, add the redirect URL provided in the Prolific study setup (e.g. `https://app.prolific.co/submissions/complete?cc=I2PWSFRG`)

    Copy from Prolific:

    ![Copy redirect URL](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel/redirect-url.webp)

    Set it up as Redirect URL in the Response Options in Formbricks:

    ![Add redirect URL to Formbricks](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel/redirect-url-formbricks.webp)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview The Study">
    Preview the study using Prolific's [Preview functionality](https://researcher-help.prolific.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360009222853-Previewing-your-study).

    ![Preview study](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/market-research-panel/preview-study.webp)

    Got to the success screen? Then you're ready to publish your study!

  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish The Study">
    After you've published the study, you'll get the first responses within a few hours.

      study.

### That's It! 🎉

Once you've published the survey, you can sit back and watch the responses come in. Prolific will take care of the rest.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with your Prolific integration, check the following common problems:

- **Redirect URL not working**: Verify that the redirect URL in Formbricks exactly matches the completion URL provided by Prolific (e.g. `https://app.prolific.co/submissions/complete?cc=YOUR_CODE`). Ensure there are no extra spaces or missing characters.
- **Hidden fields not captured**: Confirm that the hidden field IDs in Formbricks (`PROLIFIC_PID`, `STUDY_ID`, `SESSION_ID`) match the URL parameter names configured in Prolific exactly, including case sensitivity.
- **Study preview fails**: Make sure your Formbricks survey is published and the survey link is accessible before previewing the study in Prolific. An unpublished or draft survey will not load for preview participants.
- **Responses not attributed to participants**: Check that the URL parameters are correctly appended to the survey link in Prolific's study URL field. The parameters should follow the format `?PROLIFIC_PID={{%PROLIFIC_PID%}}&STUDY_ID={{%STUDY_ID%}}&SESSION_ID={{%SESSION_ID%}}`.
