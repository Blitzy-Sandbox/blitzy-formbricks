Self-hosted Formbricks instances require manual configuration for each native OAuth integration. This involves creating OAuth app credentials on the third-party platform and setting the corresponding environment variables in your Formbricks deployment.

<Note>
  If you are using **Formbricks Cloud**, native integrations work out of the box — no manual configuration is needed. See the [Cloud integration guides](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/overview) instead.

## General Configuration Requirements

All native OAuth integrations (Slack, Google Sheets, Notion, Airtable) require:

1. **An OAuth application** registered on the third-party platform with the correct redirect URI pointing to your Formbricks instance
2. **Client credentials** (Client ID and Client Secret) stored as environment variables
3. **HTTPS** enabled on your Formbricks instance — OAuth providers require secure redirect URIs

Webhook-based integrations (Zapier, n8n, Activepieces) use Formbricks webhook endpoints and do not require OAuth configuration. See each guide for specific setup steps.

## Environment Variables Overview

Each integration uses its own set of environment variables. Refer to the individual guides above for the complete list, or see the [Environment Variables](/self-hosting/configuration/environment-variables) page for a consolidated reference.
