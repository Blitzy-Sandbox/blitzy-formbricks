Embedding Formbricks surveys directly into your web pages and emails allows you to integrate interactive surveys without redirecting users to a separate survey site. This method ensures a seamless integration and maintains the aesthetic continuity of your website or application and your email marketing campaigns.

Formbricks supports three methods for embedding surveys in web pages — **iframe**, **popup**, and **inline** — plus dedicated support for embedding surveys in emails.

## Embedding Surveys in Web Pages

### Iframe Embedding

The iframe method is the most common approach for embedding surveys. It renders the survey inside an isolated `<iframe>` element, keeping survey styles completely separate from your host page. You can customize the dimensions (width, height) and enable embed mode for a seamless look.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create and Publish a Link Survey">
    Create and publish a link survey from the Formbricks dashboard.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open the Share Modal">
    Open the survey summary page and click on the **Share** button on the top right.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Embed Survey">
    In the survey share modal, click on the **Embed survey** button.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the Embed Code">
    Navigate to the **Embed in a Web Page** tab and click on **Copy code**.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Paste Into Your Web Page">
    Paste the copied iframe code into the HTML of your web page where you want the survey to appear.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Example of Embedding a Survey on a Web Page

```html Example Embedding Code
<div style="position: relative; height:100vh; max-height:100vh; overflow:auto;">
  <iframe
    src="https://app.formbricks.com/s/<your-surveyId>"
    frameborder="0"
    style="position: absolute; left:0; top:0; width:100%; height:100%; border:0;"
  >
  </iframe>
</div>
```

## Iframe Events

The iframe fires a **formbricksSurveyCompleted** event when a user finishes a survey within the embedded iframe. This event can be captured through a message listener in your webpage's JavaScript

### How To Use It

1. Embed the Formbricks survey on your webpage using the iframe method as described above.

2. Add an event listener to your webpage’s JavaScript that listens for `message` events from the iframe.

3. Check if the received message indicates that the survey is completed by comparing the `event.data` with the value `formbricksSurveyCompleted`.

<Note>
  It is important to verify the origin of the message to ensure it comes from
  the iframe containing your survey, enhancing the security of your event
  handling.
</Note>

4. Implement your custom actions within the callback function based on the survey completion.

### Example of Handling Survey Completion Events

```javascript Example Code for Event Listener
window.addEventListener("message", (event) => {
  // Replace 'https://app.formbricks.com' with the actual web app url
  if (
    event.origin === "https://app.formbricks.com" &&
    event.data === "formbricksSurveyCompleted"
  ) {
    console.log("Survey completed!");
    // Implement your custom actions here
  }
});
```

## Embed Mode

Embed your survey with a minimalist design, disregarding padding and background.

### How To Enable Embed Mode

It can be enabled by simply appending **?embed=true** to your survey link or from UI

1. Open Website embed tab in survey share modal

2. Toggle **Embed mode**

   ![Toggle embed mode](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/embed-surveys/embed-mode-toggle.webp)

   With Embed mode enabled:

   ![Toggle embed mode](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/embed-surveys/embed-mode-enabled.webp)

   With Embed mode disabled:

   ![Toggle embed mode](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/embed-surveys/embed-mode-disabled.webp)

## Popup Embedding

Popup embedding displays the survey in a modal or overlay triggered by a user action such as a button click. This approach keeps the survey hidden until the user is ready, reducing visual clutter while maintaining engagement.

### When To Use Popup Embedding

- You want to prompt feedback at a specific moment (e.g., after a purchase or at exit intent)
- The survey should not occupy permanent space on the page
- You need a non-intrusive survey experience that the user initiates

### Popup Example

Use the following code snippet to open a Formbricks link survey in a centered modal overlay when a button is clicked:

```html Popup Embedding Example
<!-- Trigger button -->
<button id="survey-trigger" style="padding: 10px 20px; cursor: pointer;">
  Give Feedback
</button>

<!-- Modal overlay -->
<div id="survey-modal" style="display:none; position:fixed; top:0; left:0; width:100%; height:100%;
  background:rgba(0,0,0,0.5); z-index:9999; justify-content:center; align-items:center;">
  <div style="position:relative; width:90%; max-width:700px; height:80vh; background:#fff; border-radius:8px; overflow:hidden;">
    <button onclick="document.getElementById('survey-modal').style.display='none'"
      style="position:absolute; top:8px; right:12px; z-index:10; background:none; border:none; font-size:20px; cursor:pointer;">
      &times;
    </button>
    <iframe
      src="https://app.formbricks.com/s/<your-surveyId>?embed=true"
      frameborder="0"
      style="width:100%; height:100%; border:0;">
    </iframe>
  </div>
</div>

<script>
  document.getElementById("survey-trigger").addEventListener("click", function () {
    document.getElementById("survey-modal").style.display = "flex";
  });
</script>
```

### Popup Configuration Options

| Option | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Trigger element** | Any clickable element — button, link, or image — that opens the modal |
| **Modal size** | Control the modal dimensions with `max-width` and `height` CSS properties |
| **Backdrop** | The semi-transparent overlay behind the modal; adjust `background` opacity as needed |
| **Close behavior** | Add a close button inside the modal and optionally close when clicking the backdrop |
| **Embed mode** | Append `?embed=true` to the survey URL for a borderless look inside the modal |

<Note>
  You can combine popup embedding with the **formbricksSurveyCompleted** iframe event to automatically close the modal when the respondent finishes the survey.
</Note>

## Inline Embedding

Inline embedding renders the survey directly within the page content without an iframe wrapper. This method integrates the survey more seamlessly with your page styles and avoids the cross-origin restrictions that come with iframes.

### When To Use Inline Embedding

- You want the survey to inherit your page's CSS styles (fonts, colors, spacing)
- You need the survey to feel like a native part of the page rather than an isolated widget
- You want to avoid iframe-related limitations such as fixed height or scrollbar issues

### Inline Example

To embed a survey inline, load the Formbricks JS SDK and initialize it with a target container element:

```html Inline Embedding Example
<!-- Container where the survey will render -->
<div id="formbricks-survey" style="max-width: 700px; margin: 0 auto;"></div>

<script type="text/javascript">
  // Load the survey via the Formbricks JS SDK
  !function(){
    var f = document.createElement("script");
    f.src = "https://app.formbricks.com/js/surveys.umd.cjs";
    f.async = true;
    f.onload = function() {
      window.formbricksSurveys.renderSurvey({
        surveyId: "<your-surveyId>",
        containerId: "formbricks-survey",
        appUrl: "https://app.formbricks.com",
      });
    };
    document.head.appendChild(f);
  }();
</script>
```

### Iframe vs Inline Comparison

| Aspect | Iframe | Inline |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Style isolation** | Full isolation — survey styles do not leak into the host page | Shared — survey inherits host page styles |
| **Cross-origin** | Runs in a separate browsing context | Runs in the same browsing context |
| **Performance** | Slightly higher overhead due to separate document context | Lighter — no additional document context |
| **Responsive sizing** | Requires explicit width/height or responsive wrapper | Automatically adapts to the container size |
| **Best for** | Embedding on third-party pages or when style isolation is required | Embedding on your own pages where you control the CSS |

<Note>
  Inline embedding uses the Formbricks JS SDK. Make sure the SDK script URL points to your self-hosted instance if you are not using Formbricks Cloud.

## Embedding the Survey in Emails

Different email clients have different support for HTML and CSS. We recommend testing the email in different email clients to ensure the survey looks good in all of them.

Below are some of the methods and services that we know that allows HTML embedding and how you can use them:

<Note>
  Please use the below methods at your own discretion. We do not officially
  endorse any of the services mentioned below.
</Note>

### 1. Gmail

Gmail does not support HTML embedding natively. It's a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor. However, you can use a free plugin like [HTML Editor for Gmail by cloudHQ](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/free-html-editor-for-gmai/ioinaaeeacahcmbgfmeaaofhfkijpdeb) to embed HTML in your emails.

- Install the plugin from the Chrome Web Store.
- Open Gmail and compose a new email.
- Write your email content after which you want to embed the survey.

  ![Email content without embedded survey](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/embed-surveys/email-content-without-survey.webp)

- Right next to the Send button you will see a new button called **HTML Editor**. Click on it.
- This will open a new window with the **Design** tab active. Switch to the **Source** tab.

  ![HTML Editor plugin Source tab in Gmail](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/embed-surveys/plugin-source-tab.webp)

- Now paste the copied HTML code from Formbricks into this window. On the right, you will see a preview of how the email will look.

  ![Adding survey HTML code in plugin editor](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/embed-surveys/plugin-add-survey.webp)

- Click on the **Close Editor** button to save the changes & close the editor.

<Note>
  Please note that the above methods are not exhaustive and there are many other
  ways to embed HTML in emails.
</Note>

## Example: Email Footer Survey

Embed a survey link in your email signature to collect feedback subtly yet effectively. Here’s how:

![Email signature with embedded survey feedback links](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/embed-surveys/jo-signature.webp)

1. Create a Survey: Adjust an existing survey or create a new one.
2. Scroll down & enable the **Hidden Fields** option.
3. Add a new hidden field with the name **helpful**.
4. Now Publish the survey as a Link Survey & copy the link.
5. Embed in Your Signature: Add this HTML snippet to your email signature in your email client settings.

```html Embed this in your Email
Was our conversation helpful?
<a href="<Link-Survey-URL>?helpful=Yes">Yes 👍</a> |
<a href="<Link-Survey-URL>?helpful=No">No 👎</a>
```

Replace `YOUR_SURVEY_LINK` with the actual survey link.

PS: If you do not see any signature settings, just use one of the methods we've mentioned above to embed the HTML code in your email.
