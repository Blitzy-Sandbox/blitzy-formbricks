  Email Follow-ups is an Enterprise Edition feature. You need an active [Enterprise License](/self-hosting/advanced/license) to use this feature. For self-hosted instances, ensure your license key is configured before enabling follow-ups.

## What Are Email Follow-Ups?

Email followups allow you to automatically send customized emails to respondents based on their survey responses or when they reach specific survey endings. This feature is perfect for:
- Sending thank you notes
- Following up with respondents
- Providing additional information
- Sharing survey response data

### Trigger Types

Each follow-up is configured with a trigger that determines when the email is sent:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Response-Based" icon="check">
    Emails are sent whenever a survey response is completed, regardless of which ending the respondent reaches. This is ideal for thank-you emails, confirmation receipts, or response summaries that apply to all respondents.
  </Card>

  <Card title="Ending-Based" icon="flag-checkered">
    Emails are triggered only when respondents reach specific survey endings. You can select one or more endings to target, allowing you to send different follow-up emails based on how the respondent completed the survey — for example, sending a discount code only to respondents who expressed dissatisfaction.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  When using ending-based triggers, you must select at least one survey ending. If a respondent does not reach any of the selected endings, the follow-up email is skipped.
</Note>

## Setting Up Email Follow-ups

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go To Follow-Ups Section And Create New Follow-Up">
    Navigate to the survey editor and open the **Follow-ups** tab. Click **Add Follow-up** to create a new follow-up action. Give your follow-up a descriptive name so you can identify it later.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Select A Trigger Type">
    Choose when the follow-up email should be sent:

    - **Response-based:** Select this to send emails whenever any survey response is completed.
    - **Ending-based:** Select this and then choose one or more specific survey endings. The email is only sent when a respondent reaches one of the selected endings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Recipients">
    The **To** field determines who receives the follow-up email. Available recipient options depend on your survey configuration:

    <ul>
      <li><strong>Verified Email:</strong> The email address entered in the email verification step (available when email verification is enabled for the survey)</li>
      <li><strong>Email Questions:</strong> Responses to question type `Open Text` with input type set to `email`</li>
      <li><strong>Contact Info:</strong> The email address from responses to the `Contact Info` question type</li>
      <li><strong>Hidden Fields:</strong> Values from hidden fields passed via URL parameters</li>
      <li><strong>Team Members:</strong> Email addresses of members in your team</li>
      <li><strong>Yourself:</strong> Your own email address</li>
    </ul>

    <Image src="/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/email-followups/followup-recipient.webp" alt="Follow-up recipient configuration showing available email sources" />
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up Reply-To">
    Configure one or more reply-to email addresses so respondents can reply directly to the follow-up email:

    - Add email addresses by typing them and pressing **Space** or **Comma** to confirm each entry
    - At least one valid reply-to address is required
    - Invalid email addresses are automatically rejected and will not be added
    - You can add multiple reply-to addresses to route responses to different team members
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Email Template">
    Customize the email content that respondents will receive:

    <Image src="/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/email-followups/followup-content.webp" alt="Follow-up email content configuration with subject and body fields" />

    **Subject Line:**
    Enter a custom subject line for your follow-up email. Keep it concise and relevant to the survey context.

    **Email Body:**
    The body editor supports rich text formatting with the following HTML tags:

    | Tag | Purpose |
    |-----|---------|
    | `<p>` | Paragraphs |
    | `<span>` | Inline text styling |
    | `<b>`, `<strong>` | Bold text |
    | `<i>`, `<em>` | Italic text |
    | `<a>` | Hyperlinks (only `http` and `https` URLs are allowed) |
    | `<br>` | Line breaks |

    <Warning>
      All HTML content is sanitized before sending. Only the tags listed above are permitted — any other HTML tags or attributes are automatically stripped for security.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Response Data Attachments">
    Optionally include survey response data in the follow-up email to provide respondents or team members with a summary of submitted answers.

    Enable the **Attach Response Data** toggle to include the full response in the email. When enabled, the following data types are supported:

    - **Question responses** — answers to all survey questions including text, ratings, selections, and more
    - **File uploads** — links to uploaded files with resolved storage URLs
    - **Picture selections** — resolved image URLs for picture selection responses
    - **Rankings** — ranked choice responses displayed in order
    - **Translations** — responses rendered in the language used by the respondent

    You can also toggle additional data inclusion:
    - **Include Variables** — appends calculated survey variable values to the email
    - **Include Hidden Fields** — appends hidden field values passed via URL parameters
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save To Activate">
    Once you have configured all settings, click **Save** on your survey to activate the email follow-up. Follow-ups are processed automatically when the configured trigger conditions are met.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Whitelabel Options

<Note>
  Whitelabel email follow-ups is an Enterprise Edition feature. You need an active [Enterprise License](/self-hosting/advanced/license) to remove Formbricks branding from follow-up emails.
</Note>

With the Enterprise Edition, you can customize the branding of follow-up emails sent to respondents. This includes replacing the default Formbricks logo with your organization's logo, ensuring a consistent brand experience.

- **Custom Logo:** Upload your organization logo via the project settings. The logo URL is automatically applied to all follow-up emails.
- **Branding Removal:** Enterprise license holders can remove the "Powered by Formbricks" footer from follow-up emails.

<Note>
  Emails sent to your organization's team members (such as team invitations) remain Formbricks branded, regardless of whitelabel settings.
</Note>

For detailed whitelabel configuration instructions, see [White-label Follow-ups](/self-hosting/advanced/enterprise-features/whitelabel-email-follow-ups).

## Email Delivery And Troubleshooting

Follow-up emails require a properly configured SMTP server. Without SMTP configuration, follow-up emails cannot be delivered.

### SMTP Configuration

Ensure your SMTP settings are configured in your environment variables. For self-hosted instances, refer to the [SMTP Configuration Guide](/self-hosting/configuration/smtp) for detailed setup instructions.

### Common Issues

| Issue | Cause | Resolution |
|-------|-------|------------|
| Emails not sending | SMTP not configured | Configure SMTP environment variables (`MAIL_FROM`, `SMTP_HOST`, `SMTP_PORT`, `SMTP_USER`, `SMTP_PASSWORD`) |
| Recipient not receiving | Invalid email in response data | Ensure the survey question capturing the email uses the `email` input type for validation |
| Follow-up skipped | Ending-based trigger with no matching ending | Verify the respondent reached one of the selected survey endings |
| Rate limit exceeded | Too many follow-up emails in a short period | Wait and retry — follow-up emails are rate-limited per organization to prevent abuse |
| Permission denied | License not active or plan does not support follow-ups | Verify your [Enterprise License](/self-hosting/advanced/license) is active and correctly configured |

### Duplicate Follow-Ups

You can create multiple follow-up actions for the same survey to send different emails based on different trigger conditions. Use the duplicate feature to quickly create variations of existing follow-ups.
