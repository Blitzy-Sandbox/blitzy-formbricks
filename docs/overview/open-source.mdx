The open core of the Formbricks software is available under the AGPLv3 license. This means you can use, modify, and distribute the software as long as you adhere to the [terms of the license.](https://www.tldrlegal.com/license/gnu-affero-general-public-license-v3-agpl-3-0) The open-source version of Formbricks is free to use, even for commercial purposes. Over time, all survey features will remain part of the free Community Edition.

## Licensing Model

Formbricks uses a dual-licensing approach to ensure long-term sustainability of the open-source project while providing advanced capabilities for larger organizations:

- **Core Platform (AGPLv3):** All content outside of `apps/web/modules/ee/` is licensed under the [GNU Affero General Public License v3](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/LICENSE). You are free to use, modify, and distribute the core platform, including for commercial purposes, as long as you publish your modifications under AGPLv3.
- **Enterprise Edition (Proprietary):** All content under `apps/web/modules/ee/` is licensed under a separate [Enterprise License](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/apps/web/modules/ee/LICENSE). These modules require a paid license key to unlock advanced features designed for larger teams and enterprises.
- **SDK Packages (MIT):** Content in `packages/js/`, `packages/android/`, `packages/ios/`, and `packages/api/` is licensed under the permissive MIT license, allowing maximum flexibility for integrating Formbricks into your applications.

<Note>
  Enterprise features located in `apps/web/modules/ee/` are licensed under a proprietary license and require
  a paid license key. The core survey platform remains free under AGPLv3. For more details on managing your
  license, see the [License Management](/self-hosting/advanced/license) guide.

## Why Open Source

| Advantage             | Open Source Software                                         | Proprietary Software                                             |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Privacy**      | Self-host for maximum control over data.                     | Dependent on third party data processor.                         |
| **Cost**              | Often free or significantly lower cost.                      | Typically, requires a purchase or subscription.                  |
| **Customizability**   | Code can be modified to meet specific needs.                 | Limited customization, restricted to developer's features.       |
| **Security**          | Frequent community reviews identify vulnerabilities quickly. | Security updates depend on vendor's schedule and interest.       |
| **Flexibility**       | Supports a wide range of applications and integrations.      | Designed for specific environments and integrations.             |
| **Community Support** | Large, active communities offer free support and resources.  | Paid customer support with limited community help.               |
| **Innovation**        | Fosters rapid innovation through community contributions.    | Innovations depend on vendor's vision and development team.      |
| **Licensing**         | Permissive licenses allow broad usage and modification.      | Strict licensing with limited redistribution rights.             |
| **Independence**      | Not dependent on a single vendor or developer.               | Vendor lock-in can limit future choices.                         |
| **Transparency**      | Full visibility into the code base and development.          | Closed-source, code is hidden from users.                        |
| **Interoperability**  | Supports open standards, ensuring interoperability.          | Often requires additional software or plugins for compatibility. |
| **Self-Hosting**      | Full self-hosting with Docker, Kubernetes, and one-click setup. | Typically SaaS-only with no self-hosting option.              |
