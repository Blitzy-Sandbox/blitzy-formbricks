<Note>
  This endpoint requires a valid `x-api-key` header with **write** permission for the environment containing the response's survey. See [Generate API Key](/api-reference/generate-key) for setup instructions.
</Note>

## Update Payload

The update request body accepts the same fields as the create request, allowing you to modify an existing response:

- **`data`** (object): Updated answer data keyed by question IDs. Provide only the fields you want to update — existing data for other question IDs is preserved.
- **`finished`** (boolean): Set to `true` to mark a partial submission as complete. Setting `finished: true` triggers follow-up emails and completion-based webhooks.
- **`language`** (string): Update the response language code

### Completing A Partial Submission

To complete a previously partial response:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "clx1234abcdef": "Updated answer"
  },
  "finished": true
}
```

<Warning>
  Updating a response triggers the response pipeline. If `finished` is set to `true` (and was previously `false`), this triggers the `responseFinished` webhook event, follow-up emails, and integration dispatches. The `responseUpdated` webhook event is triggered on every update regardless of the `finished` flag.
</Warning>

## Authorization

The API key must have `PUT` permission for the environment where the response's survey belongs. The endpoint performs a two-step authorization:
1. Fetches the response by ID
2. Looks up the survey to determine the environment
3. Validates the API key has `PUT` permission for that environment

If authorization fails at any step, a `401 Unauthorized` response is returned.

## Error Responses

The following error scenarios may be returned by this endpoint:

| Status Code | Error              | Description                                                                                              |
| ----------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `404`       | Not Found          | No response exists with the given `responseId`.                                                          |
| `401`       | Unauthorized       | The API key does not have `PUT` permission for the environment associated with the response's survey.     |
| `422`       | Validation Error   | The request body failed validation (e.g., invalid data format, unknown question IDs, file upload errors). |

## Quota Evaluation

<Note>
  Response updates that mark a response as `finished: true` may be subject to quota evaluation, similar to response creation. If the project has exceeded its monthly response quota, marking a response as finished may be rejected.
