title: "Advanced Targeting"
description: "Advanced Targeting allows you to show surveys to a specific segment of your users. You can target surveys based on user attributes, device type, and more. This helps you get more relevant insights while keeping survey fatigue at a minimum. After the initial setup, you can target any segment without touching code."

## When To Use Advanced Targeting?

Advanced Targeting helps you achieve a number of goals:

1. **Relevance**: Keep survey content relevant to respondents.

2. **Cohort-analysis**: Survey specific user cohorts only.

3. **Statistical Relevance:** When surveying a smaller subset of users, statistical relevance is reached with a lot less responses.

## How Does Advanced Targeting Work?

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Segment">
    To get started, go to the Contacts tab and create a new Segment:

    ![Create a new segment](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/targeting/contacts.webp "Create a new segment")

  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Segment based on attributes">
    In the Segment editor, you can configure your Segment with a combination of Attributes, Segments and Devices. If a user matches either or all of the criteria, they become part of the Segment. See [Segment Configuration](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/advanced-targeting#segment-configuration) below.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a survey of type Website & App">
    Create a new survey and go to Settings to change it to Website & App survey:

    ![Create a new segment of type in-app](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/targeting/survey-type.webp "Create a new segment")
  </Step>

  <Step title="Choose Segment in Targeting options">
    ![Choose Segment in Targeting options](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/targeting/target-audience.webp "Choose Segment in Targeting options")

  </Step>

</Steps>

## Segment Configuration

There are three means to move Contacts in or out of Segments: **Attributes**, other **Segments** and **Devices**:

1. **Attributes**: If the value of a specific attribute matches, the user becomes part of the Segment.

  ![Attribute filter](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/targeting/attribute-filter.webp "Attribute filter")

### Attribute Operators

When configuring an attribute filter, you select an operator to define how the attribute value is evaluated. The available operators depend on the attribute data type.

**String Attribute Operators**

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `equals` | Matches when the attribute value is exactly equal to the specified value | Plan equals "Pro" |
| `not equals` | Matches when the attribute value is not equal to the specified value | Plan not equals "Free" |
| `contains` | Matches when the attribute value contains the specified substring | Email contains "@company.com" |
| `does not contain` | Matches when the attribute value does not contain the specified substring | Email does not contain "@competitor.com" |
| `starts with` | Matches when the attribute value begins with the specified prefix | Name starts with "John" |
| `ends with` | Matches when the attribute value ends with the specified suffix | Email ends with ".edu" |
| `is set` | Matches when the attribute has any value assigned (is not empty or null) | Company is set |
| `is not set` | Matches when the attribute has no value assigned (is empty or null) | Phone is not set |

**Number Attribute Operators**

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `equals` | Matches when the numeric value is exactly equal | Age equals 30 |
| `not equals` | Matches when the numeric value is not equal | Age not equals 0 |
| `less than` | Matches when the numeric value is less than the specified value | Usage less than 100 |
| `less or equal` | Matches when the numeric value is less than or equal to the specified value | Score less or equal 50 |
| `greater than` | Matches when the numeric value is greater than the specified value | Purchases greater than 5 |
| `greater or equal` | Matches when the numeric value is greater than or equal to the specified value | Revenue greater or equal 1000 |
| `is set` | Matches when the numeric attribute has any value assigned | Revenue is set |
| `is not set` | Matches when the numeric attribute has no value assigned | Revenue is not set |

**Date Attribute Operators**

| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `is older than` | Matches when the date is older than the specified relative time | Signup is older than 30 days |
| `is newer than` | Matches when the date is newer than the specified relative time | Last login is newer than 7 days |
| `is before` | Matches when the date is before the specified absolute date | Created is before 2025-01-01 |
| `is after` | Matches when the date is after the specified absolute date | Upgraded is after 2025-06-01 |
| `is between` | Matches when the date falls between two specified dates | Signup is between 2025-01-01 and 2025-06-30 |
| `is same day` | Matches when the date is on the same day as the specified date | Birthday is same day 2025-03-15 |
| `is set` | Matches when the date attribute has any value assigned | Last active is set |
| `is not set` | Matches when the date attribute has no value assigned | Churn date is not set |

<Note>
  The `is set` and `is not set` operators do not require a value input — they simply check whether the attribute exists on the contact.
</Note>

2. **Segments**: You can nest Segments meaning that if a user is or is not part of another Segment, they can be included or excluded.

   ![Segments filter](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/targeting/segments-filter.webp "Segments filter")

3. **Devices**: If a user uses a Phone or Desktop, you can include or exclude them.

   ![Devices filter](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/targeting/device-filter.webp "Devices filter")

4. **Filter Groups:** You can group any of the above conditions in a group and connect them logically with `AND` or `OR`. This allows for maximum granularity.

## Managing Segments

Beyond creating segments through the workflow above, you can also edit and delete existing segments from the Contacts tab.

### Editing A Segment

To edit an existing segment:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to the Contacts tab">
    Go to the **Contacts** tab in your project and select the **Segments** sub-tab to view all existing segments.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Open the segment">
    Click on the segment you want to edit to open its settings. Alternatively, click the edit icon next to the segment name in the segment table.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Update filters or rename">
    In the segment editor, you can:
    - **Rename** the segment by updating the segment title.
    - **Add new filters** using the filter button to add attribute, segment, or device conditions.
    - **Modify existing filters** by changing the operator, value, or attribute for any existing condition.
    - **Remove filters** by clicking the remove icon on individual filter rows.
    - **Reorganize filter groups** by adjusting the `AND` / `OR` connectors between conditions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Save changes">
    Click **Save changes** to apply the updated segment configuration. All surveys targeting this segment will automatically use the updated criteria.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Deleting A Segment

To delete a segment you no longer need:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to segment settings">
    Open the segment from the **Contacts** → **Segments** tab and go to the segment settings.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Delete the segment">
    Click the **Delete** button in the segment settings. A confirmation dialog will appear to prevent accidental deletion.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Confirm deletion">
    Confirm the deletion. Any surveys that were targeting this segment will revert to showing to all users.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Warning>
  Deleting a segment is permanent and cannot be undone. Surveys using the deleted segment will fall back to their default targeting behavior.
</Warning>
