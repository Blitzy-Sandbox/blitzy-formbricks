You can start a survey at a specific question from the survey using the URL to skip the initial questions. This is useful when you want to link to a specific question from an external source or want to use the same survey in different parts of the user journey.

## How To Use It

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open The Survey Editor">
    In the Survey Editor, open the Questions Tab and ensure the survey is set as a **Link Survey**.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy The Question ID">
    Find the question you want to start at, click on **Show Advanced Settings**, and copy the **Question ID**.

    <Note>
      Each question has a unique Question ID, which is used to identify it in the
      survey. You can use different Question IDs for multiple **startAt** points in
      the URL.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Append The StartAt Parameter">
    Append `?startAt=question_id` to your survey's URL, replacing `question_id` with the copied Question ID.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Share The Modified URL">
    Share this modified URL with your users to start the survey at the specified question.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Sample Link Survey URL With StartAt

```sh Example Link Survey URL with startAt configured
https://formbricks.com/clny997dj087ho30fdzyf4nkl?startAt=bqd29m94l9k0hnc3azbrexl8
```

## Invalid Question ID Behavior

If you provide an invalid or non-existent Question ID in the `startAt` parameter, Formbricks gracefully handles the error. The invalid `startAt` parameter is silently removed from the URL, and the survey starts from the beginning (or from the welcome card, if enabled). No error message is displayed to the respondent.

<Note>
  To target the welcome card specifically, use `?startAt=start` as the parameter value. This only works
  when the welcome card is enabled in your survey settings.
</Note>

## Combining StartAt With Other URL Parameters

You can combine the `startAt` parameter with other link survey URL parameters to create more powerful survey experiences. Separate multiple parameters with `&`:

```sh Combining startAt with source tracking
https://formbricks.com/s/clny997dj087ho30fdzyf4nkl?startAt=bqd29m94l9k0hnc3azbrexl8&source=Google
```

```sh Combining startAt with data prefilling and skip
https://formbricks.com/s/clny997dj087ho30fdzyf4nkl?startAt=bqd29m94l9k0hnc3azbrexl8&question_id_1=answer_1&skipPrefilled=true
```

Common parameter combinations include:

- **`startAt` + `source`**: Skip to a specific question while tracking where the respondent came from (e.g., email campaign, landing page).
- **`startAt` + `skipPrefilled`**: Jump to a question and skip any prefilled questions that follow, streamlining the survey flow.
- **`startAt` + data prefilling**: Combine starting at a specific question with prefilled answers for a fully personalized experience. See [Data Prefilling](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/data-prefilling) for details.

## Use Cases

- **Link to a specific question from an external source:** Direct users to a specific question in your survey from emails, chatbots, or web pages, providing a seamless experience.

  ```sh Link from an email campaign with source tracking
  https://formbricks.com/s/clny997dj087ho30fdzyf4nkl?startAt=bqd29m94l9k0hnc3azbrexl8&source=EmailCampaign
  ```

- **Use the same survey in different parts of the user journey:** Employ the same survey at various stages of the user journey, starting at different questions to gather comprehensive insights.

  ```sh Start at a feedback question for post-purchase users
  https://formbricks.com/s/clny997dj087ho30fdzyf4nkl?startAt=feedback_question_id
  ```

- **Create a personalized survey experience:** Combine `startAt` with [data prefilling](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/data-prefilling) to tailor the survey experience by starting at a particular question and pre-populating known answers, enhancing engagement.

  ```sh Personalized survey with prefilled name and start at follow-up
  https://formbricks.com/s/clny997dj087ho30fdzyf4nkl?startAt=followup_question_id&name=Jane&skipPrefilled=true
  ```
