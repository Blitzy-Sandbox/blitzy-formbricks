Experience Management is the practice of measuring and managing how a stakeholder group of an organization (customers, employees, patients, citizens, etc...) experience the products or services of the organization.

Formbricks is a comprehensive open-source Experience Management platform with 26 features spanning survey creation, multi-channel distribution, analytics, integrations, and enterprise-grade access control. Distribute surveys across 4 channels — in-app, website, link, and email — and choose from 15 question types to build the perfect experience measurement workflow.

Historically, Experience Management has three steps:

1. **Gather** data

2. **Analyze** and report on the data

3. **Integrate** and automate to measure experiences at scale

## Survey Creation Workflow
