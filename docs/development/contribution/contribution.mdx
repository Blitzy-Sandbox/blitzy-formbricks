## Overview

We're excited that you want to contribute to Formbricks! Formbricks is an open-source experience management platform licensed under **AGPLv3**, and community contributions help make it better for everyone.

There are many ways to get involved:

- **Report Issues** — Found a bug or deployment problem? Open an issue so we can address it quickly.
- **Suggest Features** — Have an idea for improvement? Propose it as an Enhancement.
- **Submit Pull Requests** — Fix bugs, improve documentation, or add new capabilities.
- **Improve Documentation** — Help keep our docs accurate, clear, and comprehensive.

Before diving in, we recommend engaging with the community on [**GitHub Discussions**](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/discussions) to validate ideas and coordinate efforts.

## Contribution Workflow

Follow these steps to contribute code or documentation to Formbricks:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Fork the Repository">
    Fork the Formbricks repository on GitHub and clone it locally:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/formbricks && cd formbricks
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create a Feature Branch">
    Create a branch from `main` with a descriptive name:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b feat/your-feature-name
    ```

    Use prefixes like `feat/`, `fix/`, or `docs/` to indicate the type of change.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set Up the Development Environment">
    Install dependencies and start Docker development services:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    cp .env.example .env
    pnpm db:up
    pnpm dev
    ```

    For detailed environment setup instructions, see the [Local Setup Guides](/development/local-setup/mac).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Make Your Changes">
    Develop your feature or fix following the project's [Coding Standards](/development/standards/practices/code-formatting) and [File Organization](/development/standards/organization/file-and-directory-organization) conventions.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test Your Changes">
    Run the test suite before submitting:

    ```bash
    pnpm lint
    pnpm test
    pnpm test:e2e
    ```

    Ensure all linting rules pass, unit tests succeed, and end-to-end tests remain green.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Submit a Pull Request">
    Push your branch and open a PR against the `main` branch. Include a clear description of your changes, the motivation behind them, and any relevant issue references. The CLA bot will prompt you to sign the Contributor License Agreement before the PR can be merged.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug? Encountering deployment problems? Have user feedback to share? Your quickest route to help is by [raising an issue](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/issues/new/choose).

When reporting an issue, please include:

- **Reproduction steps** — A clear, step-by-step description of how to trigger the issue.
- **Expected vs. actual behavior** — What you expected to happen and what actually happened.
- **Environment details** — Browser, OS, Formbricks version, self-hosted or cloud, and any relevant configuration.

## Feature Requests

Have a great idea that could make Formbricks even better? We welcome feature proposals:

- Open an issue on [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/issues/new/choose) and tag it as **Enhancement**.
- Clearly describe the **use case** and the **"why"** behind your request — what problem does it solve?
- Consider starting the conversation on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/discussions) first to gather feedback and validate the idea with the community.

*Source: `CONTRIBUTING.md`*

## Pull Request Guidelines

- **Small fixes** (1–5 lines of code): Feel free to submit directly.
- **Larger changes**: Please discuss first on [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/discussions) before investing significant effort.

<Note>
  The Formbricks team currently has limited capacity for facilitating community code contributions. We've decided to focus on facilitating community code contributions in rare exceptions in the coming months. Starting a discussion before submitting a large PR helps ensure your work aligns with the project's priorities.
</Note>

When submitting a PR:

- Reference any related issues using `Closes #123` or `Fixes #456` syntax.
- Provide a clear, concise description of the changes.
- Ensure all tests pass (`pnpm lint`, `pnpm test`, `pnpm test:e2e`).
- Follow the project's coding standards and naming conventions.

## Contributor License Agreement

To keep Formbricks sustainable, we require a **Contributor License Agreement (CLA)** from all contributors.

Once you open a PR, our **CLA bot** will automatically prompt you to sign the agreement. We can only merge contributions after the CLA is signed.

## Development Prerequisites

The following tools are required to develop Formbricks locally:

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| **Node.js** | ≥20.0.0 | LTS versions recommended |
| **pnpm** | 10.28.2 | Package manager with workspace support |
| **Docker** | Latest stable | Required for development services |

### Development Docker Services

Formbricks uses a Docker Compose configuration (`docker-compose.dev.yml`) to run the following backing services during local development:

| Service | Image | Ports | Purpose |
|---------|-------|-------|---------|
| **PostgreSQL** | `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` | 5432 | Primary database with pgvector extension |
| **Valkey** | `valkey/valkey` | 6379 | Redis-compatible cache |
| **MinIO** | `minio/minio` | 9000 (API), 9001 (Console) | S3-compatible object storage |
| **MailHog** | `arjenz/mailhog` | 8025 (Web UI), 1025 (SMTP) | Email testing |

Start all services with:

```bash
pnpm db:up
```

Stop all services with:

```bash
pnpm db:down
```

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `pnpm install` | Install workspace dependencies pinned by `pnpm-lock.yaml` |
| `pnpm db:up` | Start Docker development services |
| `pnpm db:down` | Stop Docker development services |
| `pnpm dev` | Run all app and worker dev servers in parallel via Turborepo |
| `pnpm build` | Generate production builds for every package and app |

## Setting Up Your Development Environment

Choose the setup method that works best for you. Cloud-based environments (Gitpod and GitHub Codespaces) are recommended for a quick start — they allow you to begin coding in minutes without local configuration.
