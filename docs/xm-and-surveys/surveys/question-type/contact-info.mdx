## Elements

![Overview of Contact Info question type](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/question-type/contact-info.webp)

### Title

Specify a title to describe the information you're collecting.

### Description

Optionally, add a description to give additional context.

### Toggle Fields

The Contact Info element includes five configurable fields. Each field uses a toggle input configuration with the following properties:

- **show** (boolean) — Controls whether the field is displayed to the respondent.
- **required** (boolean) — Controls whether the field must be filled in before proceeding.
- **placeholder** — Optional placeholder text displayed inside the input when empty.

Each field can be independently configured as shown or hidden and required or optional, giving you full control over which contact details you collect.

| Field Name   | Schema Key  | Show/Hide | Required/Optional |
| ------------ | ----------- | --------- | ----------------- |
| First Name   | `firstName` | Toggle    | Toggle            |
| Last Name    | `lastName`  | Toggle    | Toggle            |
| Email        | `email`     | Toggle    | Toggle            |
| Phone Number | `phone`     | Toggle    | Toggle            |
| Company      | `company`   | Toggle    | Toggle            |

<Note>
  At least one field should have **show** enabled so that the respondent sees at least one input to fill in. When **required** is enabled for a field, the respondent must provide a value before they can continue to the next question.
</Note>

### Validation Rules

Contact Info elements support text-based validation rules that can be applied to enforce data quality on collected responses. The following validation rules are available:

| Rule              | Parameters                          | Description                                    |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `minLength`       | `{ min: number }`                   | Minimum character length for the input value   |
| `maxLength`       | `{ max: number }`                   | Maximum character length for the input value   |
| `pattern`         | `{ pattern: string, flags?: string }` | Regex pattern the input value must match       |
| `email`           | _none_                              | Validates that the input is a valid email format |
| `url`             | _none_                              | Validates that the input is a valid URL format   |
| `phone`           | _none_                              | Validates that the input is a valid phone format |
| `equals`          | `{ value: string }`                 | Input must exactly match the specified value     |
| `doesNotEqual`    | `{ value: string }`                 | Input must not match the specified value         |
| `contains`        | `{ value: string }`                 | Input must contain the specified substring       |
| `doesNotContain`  | `{ value: string }`                 | Input must not contain the specified substring   |

#### Field-Specific Validation

Validation rules can be targeted to a specific sub-field using the optional `field` property on each rule. The `field` value corresponds to one of the five Contact Info field keys:

- `firstName`
- `lastName`
- `email`
- `phone`
- `company`

This means you can apply different validation rules to different fields within the same Contact Info element. For example, you could require the `email` field to pass email format validation while applying a `minLength` rule only to the `firstName` field. When the `field` property is omitted, the rule applies broadly to the element.

When multiple validation rules are configured, they are combined using a logic operator (`and` or `or`) to determine whether the overall validation passes.

### Response Data Format

When a respondent completes a Contact Info element, the response is stored as an object with keys matching the five field names. Each key contains the text value entered by the respondent for that field:

```json
{
  "firstName": "Jane",
  "lastName": "Doe",
  "email": "jane.doe@example.com",
  "phone": "+1-555-0100",
  "company": "Acme Corp"
}
```

Only fields that have **show** enabled and that the respondent filled in will contain values. Fields that are hidden or left empty may be omitted or returned as empty strings.
