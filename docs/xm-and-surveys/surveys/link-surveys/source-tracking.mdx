Understand the source a survey respondent comes from when responding to your survey – all while keeping data privacy standards high!

Check out this video to learn more about source tracking in link surveys:

## Purpose

Source tracking for link surveys is essential when you:

- Want to analyze the origin of your survey respondents.
- Aim to ensure compliance with tracking and data collection regulations.
- Need to measure the effectiveness of different marketing channels.
- Want to attribute survey responses to specific campaigns or outreach efforts.

## Source Parameter

Formbricks uses a dedicated `?source=` URL parameter to track where survey respondents are coming from. When a user opens a link survey with this parameter, the value is captured and stored as part of the response metadata.

| Parameter | Format | Example |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| `source` | `?source=YourSource` | `?source=Google` |

<Note>
  Formbricks uses the `?source=` parameter as the primary source tracking mechanism. Standard UTM parameters (`utm_source`, `utm_medium`, `utm_campaign`) are not captured automatically. If you need to pass additional campaign metadata, consider using [Hidden Fields](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/hidden-fields) alongside source tracking.
</Note>

```sh Example Source As Google

```

## How It Works

To track the source of users in your link surveys effectively, follow these steps:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Survey URL">
    Create a Link Survey and get the sharable link. Append `?source=YourSource` to the link to reference it with your campaigns and sources.

    ```sh Example Source As Google
    https://formbricks.com/s/clin3dxja02k8l80hpwmx4bjy?source=Google
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Collect Data">
    When users access the survey through these links, the `source` URL parameter is automatically captured and stored in the response metadata. No additional configuration is required.
  </Step>

  <Step title="View Responses">
    Use the collected source data to analyze where your survey respondents are coming from. In the **Responses** tab, hover over the user icon to see the source metadata for each individual response.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Analyze Data">
    Download all the responses as a CSV or Excel file to access the source information in a dedicated **Source** column. This can provide valuable insights into which channels drive the most engagement.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Source Data In Responses

The captured source value is stored in the response `meta` object and is accessible in multiple places:

- **Responses Tab**: Hover over the user icon on any response card to see the source alongside other metadata (country, browser, OS, device, URL).
- **CSV / Excel Export**: The source appears as a dedicated column when you download responses, making it easy to filter and analyze by channel.
- **REST API**: When retrieving responses via the API, the source is included in the `meta.source` field of each response object:

```json Example API Response Meta
{
  "meta": {
    "source": "Google",
    "url": "https://formbricks.com/s/clin3dxja02k8l80hpwmx4bjy?source=Google",
    "userAgent": {
      "browser": "Chrome",
      "os": "Mac OS",
      "device": "desktop"
    },
    "country": "US"
  }
}
```

## Use Cases

Source tracking is flexible and supports a variety of attribution scenarios:

- **Marketing Channel Attribution**: Use different source values for each distribution channel (e.g., `?source=Email`, `?source=Twitter`, `?source=LinkedInAd`) to measure which channels drive the most responses.
- **Campaign Effectiveness**: Assign unique source values per campaign (e.g., `?source=Q1-Promo`, `?source=Product-Launch`) to compare performance across initiatives.
- **A/B Testing Distribution Methods**: Create separate source-tagged links for the same survey to compare engagement across different distribution strategies.
- **Partner And Referral Tracking**: Tag links shared with partners or affiliates (e.g., `?source=PartnerA`, `?source=Referral-Blog`) to measure referral-driven responses.

Source tracking allows you to make informed decisions based on the origin of your survey participants, helping you tailor your surveys and marketing strategies accordingly.
