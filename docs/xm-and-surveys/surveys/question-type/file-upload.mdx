<Note>
  **Self-Hosting Requirements**: This question type requires file upload storage to be configured. If you're
  self-hosting Formbricks, make sure to [configure file uploads](/self-hosting/configuration/file-uploads)
  before using this feature.

## Elements

![Overview of File Upload question type](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/question-type/file-upload.webp)

### Title

Add a clear title that informs the respondent about the purpose of the file upload. This maps to the `headline` field in the survey element configuration and supports internationalization (I18n) for multi-language surveys.

### Description

Provide an optional description to give respondents more details or instructions about what files they need to upload. This maps to the `subheader` field and also supports I18n strings for multi-language surveys.

### Allow Multiple Files

The `allowMultipleFiles` toggle controls whether respondents can upload a single file or multiple files in one response:

- **Enabled**: Respondents can upload several files in a single response.
- **Disabled**: Only one file can be uploaded per response.

### Max File Size

You can set a maximum file size limit per uploaded file using the `maxSizeInMB` field. The maximum allowed value depends on your Formbricks plan:

| Plan | Max File Size Per File |
| ------------ | --------------------- |
| Free         | 5 MB                  |
| Startup      | 10 MB                 |
| Enterprise   | 1 GB                  |

<Note>
  The `maxSizeInMB` property is optional. When configured, it allows you to set a custom file size limit up to the maximum allowed by your plan. File size validation is enforced client-side during the upload process.
</Note>

### Allowed File Extensions

The `allowedFileExtensions` field lets you restrict which file types respondents can upload. When configured, only files matching the specified extensions are accepted. When left unconfigured, all file types are allowed by default.

Common extension configurations include:

- **Images**: `.jpg`, `.png`, `.webp`, `.gif`
- **Documents**: `.pdf`, `.doc`, `.docx`
- **Spreadsheets**: `.xls`, `.xlsx`, `.csv`
- **Mixed**: `.pdf`, `.jpg`, `.png`, `.docx`

## Storage Backend

File uploads are stored in S3-compatible object storage. The storage backend is configurable via environment variables:

- **Cloud instances** use managed S3 storage with no additional configuration required.
- **Self-hosted instances** can use [MinIO](https://min.io/) (an open-source, S3-compatible storage server) or any other S3-compatible provider.

Key storage environment variables include:

| Variable              | Description                                                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `S3_ACCESS_KEY`       | Access key for S3-compatible storage                                |
| `S3_SECRET_KEY`       | Secret key for S3-compatible storage                                |
| `S3_REGION`           | AWS region or MinIO region                                          |
| `S3_BUCKET_NAME`      | Storage bucket name                                                 |
| `S3_ENDPOINT_URL`     | Custom endpoint URL (required for MinIO or non-AWS providers)       |
| `S3_FORCE_PATH_STYLE` | Set to `1` for path-style access (required for MinIO)               |

For detailed self-hosting storage configuration, see [File Uploads Configuration](/self-hosting/configuration/file-uploads).

## Validation Rules

The File Upload question type supports the following validation rules that can be applied to control which files respondents are allowed to submit:

| Rule                   | Description                                                                          | Parameters                  |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------- |
| `fileExtensionIs`      | Validates that the uploaded file has one of the specified extensions                  | `{ extensions: string[] }`  |
| `fileExtensionIsNot`   | Validates that the uploaded file does **not** have any of the specified extensions    | `{ extensions: string[] }`  |

Multiple validation rules can be combined using `and` or `or` logic operators.

<Note>
  File size validation rules (such as `fileSizeAtLeast` and `fileSizeAtMost`) are **not** available as response-level validation rules. This is because survey responses store only file URLs, not file metadata. File size validation is enforced client-side during the upload process via the `maxSizeInMB` element property.
