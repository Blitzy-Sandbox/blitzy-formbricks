To ensure the credibility of your survey participants and maintain high-quality data, you can require respondents to verify their email before they can view and respond to your Formbricks link surveys. This verification process helps confirm that only participants with valid email addresses can access the survey, enhancing data integrity.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Access Settings">
    Click on the **Settings** tab next to the Questions & Styling tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Response Options">

  </Step>

  <Step title="Preview Option">
    A "Preview survey questions" option is available for those who are just browsing or curious about the survey content without completing it. This allows a non-interactive view of the survey.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Verification Process">
    After entering their email, respondents receive a verification email containing a unique survey link. The email includes the survey name and a direct link to proceed. The verification link remains active as long as the survey itself is open and accepting responses.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Survey Access">
    After clicking the verification link in the email, respondents can access and respond to the survey.

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  When combined with the **Single Response Per Email** option (also found under Response Options), respondents who have already submitted a response will be notified that a response for their email address already exists. This prevents duplicate submissions from the same verified email.
</Note>

### Benefits Of Email Verification

- **Authenticity of Respondents**: Ensures that each respondent is verified, adding an extra layer of authenticity to your data collection.
- **Reduction in Spam and Fraudulent Responses**: Helps reduce unwanted or spam entries by confirming the legitimacy of each respondent's email address.
- **Enhanced Data Quality**: Increases the reliability and quality of the data collected by confirming the identity of participants.

### Visibility Of Verified Emails
