## Elements

The Net Promoter Score (NPS) question type presents a **fixed 0–10 scale** (11 points). This scale follows the industry-standard NPS methodology and is not configurable — respondents always choose a single integer value between 0 and 10.

### Title

Add a clear title to inform the respondent what information you are asking for. This maps to the `headline` field in the survey schema and is a required I18n string that supports multi-language translations.

### Description

Provide an optional description with further instructions. This maps to the `subheader` field and is an optional I18n string, so you can include translated variants when using multi-language surveys.

### NPS Score Segmentation

Formbricks automatically segments NPS responses into three industry-standard categories based on the score each respondent selects:

| Category | Score Range | Description |
|----------|------------|-------------|
| **Detractors** | 0–6 | Unhappy customers who can damage your brand through negative word-of-mouth. |
| **Passives** | 7–8 | Satisfied but unenthusiastic customers who are vulnerable to competitive offerings. |
| **Promoters** | 9–10 | Loyal enthusiasts who fuel growth through referrals and repeat engagement. |

<Note>
  The NPS formula is: **NPS = % Promoters − % Detractors**. The resulting score ranges from **−100** (all detractors) to **+100** (all promoters). This segmentation is built into Formbricks' analytics summary — when you collect NPS responses, the response dashboard automatically calculates and displays the breakdown across these three categories.

### Labels

Customize the labels displayed at the lower and upper bounds of the 0–10 scale:

- **Lower Label** (`lowerLabel`) — The text shown beneath the low end (0) of the scale. Defaults to "Not at all likely". This is an optional I18n string that supports multi-language translations.
- **Upper Label** (`upperLabel`) — The text shown beneath the high end (10) of the scale. Defaults to "Extremely likely". This is also an optional I18n string with multi-language support.

Both labels help respondents understand the meaning of the scale endpoints and can be tailored to match your specific survey context (for example, "Very Dissatisfied" and "Very Satisfied" for a satisfaction-oriented question).

### Add Color Coding

Enable visual color coding on the 0–10 scale buttons by toggling the `isColorCodingEnabled` option. When enabled, each button is color-coded according to its NPS category:

- **Red tones** for detractor scores (0–6)
- **Yellow / amber tones** for passive scores (7–8)
- **Green tones** for promoter scores (9–10)

This provides immediate visual feedback to respondents about the sentiment associated with their selection. Color coding is disabled by default and can be toggled on in the survey editor.

### Response Format

The NPS element does not include configurable validation rules. The response is always a single integer from 0 to 10 — no additional constraints (such as minimum or maximum character limits) are applicable for this question type.
