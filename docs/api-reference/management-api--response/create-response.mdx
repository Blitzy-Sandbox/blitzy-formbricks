## Request Body Details

### Required Fields

- **`surveyId`** (string, required): The ID of the survey this response belongs to

### Optional Fields

- **`data`** (object): Answer data keyed by question IDs. Each key is a question ID and the value is the respondent's answer:

      "clx5678ghijkl": ["Option A", "Option B"],
      "clx9012mnopqr": 8
    }
  }

## Pipeline Triggers

<Warning>
  Creating a response via the Management API triggers the full response pipeline. This includes webhook notifications (`responseCreated` event), integration dispatches (Slack, Google Sheets, etc.), follow-up emails (if configured and `finished` is `true`), and other configured actions.
</Warning>

## Quota Evaluation

Response creation is subject to quota evaluation. If the project's response quota has been reached (e.g., Free plan: 1,500 responses/month, Startup plan: 5,000 responses/month), the creation will be rejected with an appropriate error response.

## File Upload Validation

If the survey contains file upload questions, the response data must reference valid uploaded file URLs. File uploads are validated against configured size limits (5MB for Free, 10MB for Startup, 1GB for Enterprise).
