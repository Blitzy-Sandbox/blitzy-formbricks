## Overview

Surveys in Formbricks display a back button by default, allowing respondents to navigate to previous questions and revise their answers. In some scenarios, you may want to disable this behavior and enforce a forward-only flow.

The **Hide Back Button** setting removes the back navigation button from all questions in the survey. Once enabled, respondents can only move forward through the survey and cannot return to previously answered questions.

<Note>
  This setting is configured **per survey** and is found under **Settings &gt; Response Options** in the Survey
  Editor. It applies to all distribution channels including link surveys, website surveys, and in-app surveys.
</Note>

## How To Configure

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open The Survey Editor">
    Navigate to the survey you want to modify and open the **Survey Editor**.

  <Step title="Go To The Settings Tab">
    Click on the **Settings** tab located next to the Questions and Styling tabs.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find Response Options">
    Scroll down to the **Response Options** section within the Settings panel.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Toggle Hide Back Button">
    Locate the **Hide "Back" button** toggle and switch it on. The description reads: *Do not display the back button in the survey*.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Save Your Changes">
    Click **Save** to apply the setting. The back button will no longer appear for respondents taking this survey.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

- **Sequential Data Collection**: When survey questions build upon each other in a strict sequence and revisiting earlier answers would disrupt the logical flow.

- **Preventing Answer Changes**: In assessments, quizzes, or compliance surveys where respondents should not be able to modify previously submitted answers.

- **Timed Or Ordered Surveys**: When the survey experience is designed to be completed in a single forward pass, such as onboarding flows or progressive feedback collection.

- **Reducing Drop-Offs**: Removing the back button simplifies the survey interface, which can help respondents focus on completing the survey rather than second-guessing earlier responses.

## Impact On Survey Navigation

When the back button is hidden:

- **Respondents cannot navigate backward** — once a question is answered and the respondent moves forward, they cannot return to it.

- **The back button label configuration is skipped** — since the button is not displayed, any custom back button label set on individual questions has no effect.

- **Partial submissions still capture answered questions** — even without back navigation, the [partial submissions](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/partial-submissions) feature continues to record each answered question as the respondent progresses.

- **Conditional logic continues to function normally** — [conditional logic](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/conditional-logic) branching and skip logic are unaffected by this setting and work as configured.
