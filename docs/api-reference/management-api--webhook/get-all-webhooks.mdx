## Authentication And Permissions

<Note>
  The `x-api-key` header is **required** for this endpoint. The API key's environment permissions determine which webhooks are returned — only webhooks belonging to environments the API key has access to are listed. Ensure your API key is scoped to the correct environment to retrieve the expected webhooks.
