## Generate API Key

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate to API Keys">
    Click on the organization dropdown in the top-left corner of the page and select **Organization Settings**. Then navigate to the **API Keys** section in the settings sidebar.

    <Note>
      Only organization **owners** and **managers** can access and manage API keys. Members with other roles will not see the API Keys settings page.
    </Note>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Add a new API key">
    Click on the "Add API Key" button to open the creation modal.
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Configure your API key">
    1. Give your API key a descriptive label (e.g., "GitHub Integration", "PostHog", "Slack")
    2. Configure Project Access:
       - Select which projects and environments this key should have access to
       - Choose the permission level for each (read, write, or manage)
       - You can add access to multiple projects by clicking "Add Permission"
    3. Configure Organization Access:
       - Set appropriate read/write permissions for organization-level access
  </Step>

  <Step title="Copy your key">
    After creating the key, you'll see the API key value displayed once. Copy it immediately and store it in a secure location. For security reasons, you won't be able to view the complete API key again.
    
    <Note>
      Store your API key safely! Anyone who has your API key has access based on the permissions you've granted. For security reasons, the complete API key value cannot be viewed again after creation.
    </Note>
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  API keys use a structured format with the `fbk_` prefix (e.g., `fbk_abc123...`). The key is secured using a hybrid approach: a SHA-256 hash is used for fast lookup, while a bcrypt hash provides additional security verification. Always treat your API key as a sensitive credential.
</Note>

## Delete API Key

If you need to revoke access for an API key:

1. Go to **Organization Settings** > **API Keys** page
2. Find the key you wish to revoke and click the trash icon
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog that appears

Your API key will stop working immediately after deletion.

## API Key Permission Levels

API Keys have three permission levels that can be assigned per project/environment:

- **Read**: Can only perform read operations (GET requests)
- **Write**: Can perform read and write operations (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH requests)
- **Manage**: Has full access including delete operations (all request types)

Permissions are set per project environment (development/production), allowing fine-grained access control. For example, you can grant **read** access to production data while granting **manage** access to a development environment within the same project.

Additionally, organization-level access controls can be configured for broader permissions. Organization access supports **read** and **write** levels, which govern operations at the organization scope such as managing members or viewing organization settings.

<Note>
  API requests are subject to rate limiting. If you receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response, reduce your request frequency and implement exponential backoff in your integration.
