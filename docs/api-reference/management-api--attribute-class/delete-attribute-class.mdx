openapi: delete /api/v1/management/attribute-classes/{attributeClassId}

<Note>
  The Attribute Class endpoints are part of the v1 Management API. For new integrations, consider using the Contact Attribute Keys endpoints (`/api/v1/management/contact-attribute-keys/{contactAttributeKeyId}`). Note that "automatic" type attribute classes cannot be deleted — only "custom" types support deletion.
