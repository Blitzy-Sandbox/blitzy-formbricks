Formbricks is an open-source (AGPLv3) Experience Management (XM) and survey platform built to collect feedback from anyone—users, customers, or employees—across any channel. Available as both a cloud-hosted service and a fully self-hostable solution, Formbricks combines a powerful survey engine with advanced analytics, native integrations, and enterprise-grade access controls.

Built with Next.js 16.x, React 19.x, TypeScript, and Prisma 6.x on PostgreSQL, the platform includes a lightweight 7KB browser SDK for website and in-app surveys, a dual REST API architecture (v1 and v2), and over 6 native integrations out of the box. With 15 question types, 13+ best practice templates, and 4 distribution channels, Formbricks covers the full spectrum of feedback collection.

## Distribution Channels

Formbricks supports four distribution channels to reach your audience wherever they are:

- **Link Surveys:** Create standalone surveys and share them via a unique URL. Features include single-use links, PIN protection, personal links, data prefilling, email verification before submission, source tracking, custom head scripts, and market research panel integration. A great replacement for Google Forms, Typeform, or any other link survey tool.

- **Website Surveys:** Deploy anonymously targeted surveys on any public-facing website using the lightweight 7KB JavaScript SDK. Designed to scale to millions of visitors with minimal performance impact, supporting well-timed micro-surveys triggered by page URL, CSS selector clicks, or exit intent.

- **In-App Surveys:** Identify known users and enrich their profiles with custom attributes and actions. Build cohorts for highly targeted surveys using action-based triggers, advanced segmentation, recontact controls, and display-percentage targeting.

- **Email Surveys:** Send survey invitations and follow-up emails directly to contacts. Embed survey questions in transactional emails for higher response rates, with whitelabel branding options for a fully custom experience.

The core survey platform is free and open source under AGPLv3. All survey features, question types, and distribution channels are included in the Community Edition.

- **Tech Stack:** Next.js 16.x, React 19.x, TypeScript (sole primary language), Prisma 6.x ORM, and PostgreSQL database
- **Browser SDK:** A 7KB JavaScript SDK (`@formbricks/js`) for seamless website and in-app survey integration with minimal bundle impact
- **APIs:** Dual REST API — v1 ([OpenAPI 3.0](/api-reference/rest-api)) for client and management operations, v2 ([OpenAPI 3.1.0, Beta](/api-v2-reference/introduction)) for advanced management with `x-api-key` authentication
- **Integrations:** 6+ native integrations including [Slack](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/slack), [Google Sheets](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/google-sheets), [Notion](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/notion), [Airtable](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/airtable), [Zapier](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/zapier), and [n8n](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/n8n), plus [webhook](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/webhooks) support compliant with the Standard Webhooks specification
- **Deployment:** Self-hostable via [Docker](/self-hosting/setup/docker), [Kubernetes](/self-hosting/setup/kubernetes) (Helm charts), [one-click Ubuntu setup](/self-hosting/setup/one-click), or use [Formbricks Cloud](https://app.formbricks.com/) for a fully managed experience

## The Experience Management (XM) Suite

Formbricks goes beyond basic surveys with a comprehensive Experience Management suite. XM involves collecting, analyzing, and acting on feedback from stakeholders—customers, employees, or users—to understand and improve their experience with your product or organization.

### Why XM Matters

Helping businesses, governments, and nonprofits understand their users' experiences leads to better services and happier people. Formbricks XM provides the data and tooling needed to make decisions that put people first, with 13+ [best practice templates](/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/pmf-survey) for common use cases like PMF surveys, feedback boxes, feature chasers, churn surveys, and interview prompts.
