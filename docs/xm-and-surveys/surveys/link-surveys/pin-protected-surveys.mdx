## Enabling PIN Protection

PIN protection can be applied to your surveys easily through the survey editor. This setup allows you to control access effectively, ensuring that only authorized users can participate. When enabled, respondents must enter an exact 4-digit numeric PIN before they can view or complete the survey.

### Steps To Set Up PIN Protection

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Settings In Survey Editor">
    Navigate to your survey in the survey editor where you wish to enable PIN protection and click on the **Settings** tab.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Select Response Options">
    Find and select **Response Options** to access settings related to survey responses.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable PIN Protection">
    Find the option for **Protect Survey with a PIN** and activate it. You will be prompted to enter a 4-digit numeric PIN that respondents must use to access the survey.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Setting The PIN

Enter the 4-digit numeric PIN you wish to use for your survey. The PIN must consist of exactly four digits (0–9) — letters and special characters are not allowed. Once set, this PIN will need to be entered by participants to access the survey.

<Note>
  The PIN can be changed at any time from the **Response Options** section of the survey settings. When toggling PIN protection on for the first time, a default PIN of `1234` is pre-filled — be sure to change it to a unique value before publishing your survey.
</Note>

### User Experience Upon Accessing The Survey

When a respondent attempts to access a PIN-protected survey, they are prompted to enter the PIN:

- **PIN Entry Prompt**: A screen appears asking the respondent to enter the 4-digit PIN to proceed. This acts as the first gatekeeping step before survey access is granted.

- **Incorrect PIN Handling**: If an incorrect PIN is entered, the respondent is informed and asked to try again, ensuring secure access to the survey.

- **Correct PIN**: On entering the correct PIN, the respondent gains access to the survey and can fill it out accordingly.

### Benefits Of PIN Protection

- **Enhanced Security**: Protects the survey from unauthorized access, ensuring that only participants with the PIN can enter.

- **Controlled Participation**: Enables you to restrict survey participation to a specific group, such as during a closed testing phase or confidential feedback gathering.

- **Prevents Unwanted Access**: Deters casual browsing and unauthorized attempts to view or complete the survey.

## Security Considerations

PIN protection adds an access-control layer to your link surveys. Keep the following points in mind when using this feature:

- **PIN Format**: The PIN is restricted to exactly 4 numeric digits (validated against the pattern `^\d{4}$`). Letters, special characters, and PINs shorter or longer than 4 digits are rejected by the editor.

- **Storage**: The PIN is stored as a plain string in the database and is compared directly during validation. It is **not** hashed or encrypted at rest, so treat it as a lightweight access gate rather than a cryptographic secret.

- **No Rate Limiting on PIN Entry**: There is currently no built-in brute-force protection on the PIN entry screen. Given that a 4-digit numeric PIN has only 10,000 possible combinations, consider combining PIN protection with other access controls (such as [single-use links](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/single-use-links) or [email verification](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/verify-email-before-survey)) for surveys requiring stronger security.

- **PIN Distribution**: Share the PIN through secure channels (e.g., direct message, email to verified recipients) rather than posting it publicly. The survey creator is responsible for controlling who receives the PIN.

- **Choosing The Right Access Control**: Formbricks offers several access-control mechanisms for link surveys. Use the following guidance:

  | Method | Best For |
  | --- | --- |
  | **PIN Protection** | Quick, lightweight gating for small groups who can receive the PIN securely |
  | **[Email Verification](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/verify-email-before-survey)** | Identity-verified access where you need to confirm respondent email addresses |
  | **[Single-Use Links](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/single-use-links)** | Ensuring each respondent can only submit once, with unique URLs per participant |
  | **[Personal Links](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/personal-links)** | Tracking individual responses tied to specific contacts |

## Use Cases

PIN protection is particularly useful in situations where:

- Confidential surveys are being conducted, such as internal company feedback or sensitive research studies.

- Surveys are designed for a specific event or group, and access needs to be controlled.

- You want to limit survey responses to participants who have been explicitly invited or have registered in advance.

- You are running a quick feedback round with a small team and need a simple access barrier without generating individual links.

## Conclusion

Setting up PIN protection for your Formbricks surveys is a straightforward and effective way to ensure that only authorized respondents can access and complete your surveys. This feature adds an additional layer of security and control, making it ideal for managing access to sensitive or exclusive surveys.

For surveys requiring stronger security guarantees, consider combining PIN protection with [email verification](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/verify-email-before-survey) or [single-use links](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/single-use-links).
