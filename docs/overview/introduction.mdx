## Welcome to the Formbricks Documentation!

Formbricks is a powerful open-source experience management platform for collecting and analyzing feedback from customers, users, and employees through targeted surveys. It ships with 26 features (16 core and 10 enterprise), 15 question types, 4 distribution channels (in-app, website, link, and email surveys), 6+ native integrations (Slack, Google Sheets, Notion, Airtable, Zapier, n8n), a lightweight 7KB browser SDK, and a dual REST API (v1 and v2). Whether you need simple feedback forms, advanced experience management, or enterprise-grade features like SSO, audit logging, team-based access, and billing — Formbricks scales with your needs.

This documentation covers everything from initial setup to advanced platform customization. Follow the recommended path: start with the platform overview, set up your self-hosted instance or cloud account, create your first survey, integrate the SDK into your website or app, review analytics, and configure integrations. You will find step-by-step instructions, feature explanations, best practices, and complete API references across the sections below.
