Formbricks offers two types of APIs: the **Public Client API** and the **Management API**. Each API serves a different purpose, has *different* authentication requirements, and provides access to different data and settings.

## API Versions

Formbricks maintains two API versions:

- **API v1 (Stable)**: The current production API documented on this page. Fully supported with all client and management endpoints.
- **API v2 (Beta)**: A next-generation management API with improved authentication, standardized error responses using the Result pattern, and expanded endpoint coverage. See the [API v2 Reference](/api-v2-reference/introduction) for details.

Both API versions use the `x-api-key` header for management API authentication. The v1 API will continue to be supported alongside v2 during the transition period.

## Public Client API

The **Public Client API** is used by our SDKs and doesn’t require authentication, making it ideal for client-side interactions without exposing sensitive data.

We currently have the following Client API methods exposed and below is their documentation attached in Postman:

- [Displays API](/api-reference/client-api--display/create-display) - Mark a survey as displayed or link a display to a response for a person.

- [Responses API](/api-reference/client-api--response/create-response) - Create & Update a Response for a Survey.

## Management API

The **Management API** gives full access to all data and settings available in your Formbricks account. It requires a personal API Key for authentication, which you can generate and manage in the Settings section of the Formbricks app.

The following Management API endpoints are available:

- [Action Class API](/api-reference/management-api--action-class/get-all-action-classes) — List, Get, Create, and Delete Action Classes

- [Attribute Class API](/api-reference/management-api--attribute-class/get-all-attribute-classes) — List, Get, Create, and Delete Attribute Classes

- [Contact Attribute Keys API](/api-reference/management-api--contact-attribute-keys/get-all-contact-attribute-keys) — List and Get Contact Attribute Keys

- [Contact Attributes API](/api-reference/management-api--contact-attributes/get-all-contact-attributes) — List Contact Attributes

- [Contacts API](/api-reference/management-api--contacts/get-all-contacts) — List and Get Contacts

- [Me API](/api-reference/management-api--me/me) — Retrieve Account Information

- [People API](/api-reference/management-api--people/get-all-persons) — List, Get, and Delete People

- [Response API](/api-reference/management-api--response/get-survey-responses) — List, Get, Create, Update, and Delete Responses

- [Storage API](/api-reference/management-api--storage/upload-public-file) — Upload Public Files

- [Survey API](/api-reference/management-api--survey/get-all-surveys) — List, Get, Create, Update, Delete Surveys, and Generate Single-Use Links

- [Webhook API](/api-reference/management-api--webhook/get-all-webhooks) — List, Get, Create, and Delete Webhooks

## Authentication

The **Public Client API** does not require authentication — it uses the environment ID in the URL path.

The **Management API** requires an API key passed in the `x-api-key` header. API keys can be generated in the Formbricks app with granular project and environment permissions. See [Generate API Key](/api-reference/generate-key) for setup instructions.
