Opinion Scale questions allow respondents to express their level of agreement, satisfaction, or preference on a customizable numeric scale. Unlike the [Net Promoter Score (NPS)](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/question-type/net-promoter-score) question type — which uses a fixed 0–10 scale — the Opinion Scale supports configurable ranges: 1–5, 1–7, or 1–10. This makes it ideal for Likert-scale questions, customer satisfaction ratings, and attitudinal measurements where you need flexibility in the number of scale points.

<Note>The Opinion Scale question type is a planned feature for Typeform parity. This documentation describes the planned specification and will be updated upon implementation.</Note>

## How Opinion Scale Differs from NPS

While both the Opinion Scale and [NPS](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/question-type/net-promoter-score) collect numeric ratings, they serve different purposes and have distinct characteristics:

| Feature | Net Promoter Score (NPS) | Opinion Scale |
|---------|--------------------------|---------------|
| Scale range | Fixed 0–10 | Configurable: 1–5, 1–7, or 1–10 |
| Starting value | Always 0 | Always 1 |
| Use case | Loyalty measurement (promoters/passives/detractors) | General sentiment, Likert scales, satisfaction |
| Scoring model | Standard NPS formula (% Promoters − % Detractors) | Raw value or average aggregation |
| Color coding | Optional (0–6 red, 7–8 yellow, 9–10 green) | Optional (configurable per label) |
| Labels | Lower/upper labels (e.g., "Not at all likely" / "Extremely likely") | Lower/upper labels (fully customizable) |

NPS is specifically designed for the "How likely are you to recommend..." question pattern with an industry-standard scoring formula that categorizes respondents into promoters, passives, and detractors.

Opinion Scale is a general-purpose rating that supports broader use cases such as:

- **Agreement scales** — "Strongly disagree" to "Strongly agree"
- **Frequency scales** — "Never" to "Always"
- **Importance scales** — "Not important" to "Extremely important"
- **Satisfaction scales** — "Very unsatisfied" to "Very satisfied"

## Elements

### Title

Add a clear title to inform the respondent what opinion or preference is being measured. The title should frame the question so the respondent understands what the scale represents.

### Description

Provide an optional description with further context or instructions. Use this to clarify the scale meaning or provide additional guidance on how to respond.

### Scale Range

Configure the numeric scale range. Available options:

- **1–5** — Best for simple preference or satisfaction questions. Offers a quick and intuitive response experience with a clear midpoint at 3.
- **1–7** — Common for academic and research Likert scales. Provides additional granularity while maintaining a neutral midpoint at 4.
- **1–10** — Provides finer granularity for detailed opinion capture. Useful when you need to distinguish between subtle differences in sentiment.

### Lower and Upper Labels

Configure text labels for the endpoints of the scale:

- **Lower label** — Describes the minimum value (e.g., "Strongly disagree", "Very unsatisfied", "Not important")
- **Upper label** — Describes the maximum value (e.g., "Strongly agree", "Very satisfied", "Extremely important")

Labels help respondents understand the meaning of each end of the scale. Both labels are optional but recommended for clarity.

### Visual Style

Choose the visual presentation of the scale:

- **Numbers** — Display numeric values in buttons. Suitable for all scale ranges and provides the most neutral visual representation.
- **Stars** — Display star icons. Best suited for 1–5 scales and commonly associated with product or service ratings.
- **Sliders** — Display a slider control for continuous selection. Provides an interactive experience and works well for all scale ranges.

## Configuration

The Opinion Scale question type supports the following configuration options:

- **Scale range selection** — Choose between 1–5, 1–7, or 1–10 to match your research needs.
- **Label customization** — Set custom text for the lower and upper bounds of the scale to provide context for respondents.
- **Visual style selection** — Choose between numbers, stars, or slider display modes.
- **Required/optional toggle** — Mark the question as required to ensure respondents provide a rating before proceeding, or leave it optional to allow skipping.
- **Multi-language support** — Labels and text fields support multiple languages for international surveys, using the same internationalization system as other Formbricks question types.

## Response Format

The response value is stored as an integer within the configured scale range. For example, on a 1–5 scale, valid response values are 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5.

```json
{
  "opinionScale_q1": 4
}
```

The value represents the respondent's selection on the configured scale. In this example, a value of `4` on a 1–5 scale indicates a rating toward the upper end of the range (close to the upper label value).

When aggregating responses, you can calculate:

- **Average score** — The mean of all responses for a central tendency measure.
- **Distribution** — The count or percentage of responses at each scale point.
- **Top/bottom box scores** — The percentage of respondents selecting the highest or lowest values.

## Planned Schema Specification

The Opinion Scale element type will extend the existing survey element schema system. The proposed Zod schema follows the same patterns used by `ZSurveyRatingElement` and `ZSurveyNPSElement` in `packages/types/surveys/elements.ts`:

```typescript
// Planned extension to packages/types/surveys/elements.ts
export const ZSurveyOpinionScaleElement = ZSurveyElementBase.extend({
  type: z.literal("opinionScale"),
  scale: z.enum(["number", "star", "slider"]).default("number"),
  range: z.union([z.literal(5), z.literal(7), z.literal(10)]).default(5),
  lowerLabel: ZI18nString.optional(),
  upperLabel: ZI18nString.optional(),
  validation: ZValidation.optional(),
});

export type TSurveyOpinionScaleElement = z.infer<typeof ZSurveyOpinionScaleElement>;
```

<Note>This schema is a planned specification. The actual implementation may differ. The Opinion Scale type will be added to `TSurveyElementTypeEnum` in `packages/types/surveys/constants.ts`. Source reference: `packages/types/surveys/elements.ts`</Note>

This schema design draws from two existing element types:

- **`ZSurveyRatingElement`** uses `scale: z.enum(["number", "smiley", "star"])` and `range: z.union([z.literal(5), z.literal(3), z.literal(4), z.literal(6), z.literal(7), z.literal(10)])` for visual style and range configuration.
- **`ZSurveyNPSElement`** uses `lowerLabel`, `upperLabel`, and `isColorCodingEnabled` for endpoint label configuration.

The Opinion Scale combines aspects of both — offering a configurable range with customizable labels and flexible visual styles. The `slider` option in the `scale` enum is new and specific to the Opinion Scale type.

## API Request Example

The following JSON shows how an Opinion Scale question appears in a survey creation API payload:

```json
{
  "id": "opinion_scale_q1",
  "type": "opinionScale",
  "headline": { "default": "How satisfied are you with our service?" },
  "subheader": { "default": "Please rate your overall experience" },
  "required": true,
  "scale": "number",
  "range": 5,
  "lowerLabel": { "default": "Very unsatisfied" },
  "upperLabel": { "default": "Very satisfied" }
}
```

This payload creates an Opinion Scale question with a 1–5 numeric scale, labeled from "Very unsatisfied" to "Very satisfied". The `headline` and `subheader` fields use the internationalization object format (`{ "default": "..." }`) consistent with all other Formbricks element types.
