Payment questions allow respondents to make payments directly within a survey. Integrated with Stripe for secure payment processing, this element type supports configurable amounts, multiple currencies, and optional receipt handling — enabling use cases such as event registrations, donations, and product orders without leaving the survey experience.

<Note>The Payment question type is a planned feature for Typeform parity. This documentation describes the planned specification and will be updated upon implementation.</Note>

## Elements

### Title

Add a clear title to inform the respondent what payment is being requested (for example, "Complete Your Registration Payment" or "Make a Donation").

### Description

Provide an optional description with further details about the payment, such as what the payment covers, applicable terms, or refund policy information.

### Amount Configuration

Configure the payment amount. The following options are available:

- **Fixed amount** — A predetermined amount the respondent must pay. The amount is set during survey creation and cannot be changed by the respondent.
- **Variable amount** — Allow respondents to enter a custom amount within a defined minimum and maximum range. Useful for donations or pay-what-you-want scenarios.

Amounts are specified in the smallest currency unit (for example, cents for USD). A value of `2999` represents $29.99.

### Currency

Select the currency for the payment. Supported currencies align with Stripe's currency support, including but not limited to:

| Currency Code | Currency Name |
|---------------|---------------|
| `usd` | US Dollar |
| `eur` | Euro |
| `gbp` | British Pound |
| `cad` | Canadian Dollar |
| `aud` | Australian Dollar |
| `jpy` | Japanese Yen |

The default currency is `usd`. The full list of supported currencies is determined by your Stripe account configuration.

### Stripe Integration

Payment processing is handled via Stripe. Configuration requires:

- A connected Stripe account linked to your Formbricks environment
- Stripe publishable key and secret key configured in environment settings
- A webhook endpoint for payment confirmation callbacks

<Note>Stripe credentials are configured at the environment level. Refer to your self-hosting or cloud environment configuration for setup details.</Note>

## Configuration

The following configuration options are available for Payment questions:

| Option | Description | Default |
|--------|-------------|---------|
| **Amount type** | Fixed or variable amount | `fixed` |
| **Amount value** | Payment amount in smallest currency unit (e.g., cents) | — |
| **Min / Max** | Minimum and maximum for variable amounts | — |
| **Currency** | ISO 4217 currency code | `usd` |
| **Required** | Whether the payment must be completed to proceed | `true` |
| **Collect receipt email** | Whether to collect and send a receipt to the respondent | `false` |
| **Stripe account** | The connected Stripe account identifier | — |

Payment questions are always terminal within their block — they cannot have follow-up questions within the same block. This ensures the payment flow is completed before the respondent proceeds to the next section of the survey.

## Response Format

When a respondent completes a payment, the response data includes the Stripe payment intent details:

```json
{
  "paymentId": "pi_3N1234567890",
  "amount": 2999,
  "currency": "usd",
  "status": "succeeded",
  "receiptEmail": "respondent@example.com"
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `paymentId` | `string` | Stripe Payment Intent identifier |
| `amount` | `number` | Amount charged in smallest currency unit |
| `currency` | `string` | ISO 4217 currency code |
| `status` | `string` | Payment status (`succeeded`, `pending`, `failed`) |
| `receiptEmail` | `string` | Respondent email for receipt (if collected) |

## Planned Schema Specification

The Payment element type will extend the existing `ZSurveyElementBase` schema defined in `packages/types/surveys/elements.ts`. The following Zod schema represents the planned specification:

```typescript
// Planned extension to packages/types/surveys/elements.ts
export const ZSurveyPaymentElement = ZSurveyElementBase.extend({
  type: z.literal("payment"),
  currency: z.string().default("usd"),
  amount: z.object({
    type: z.enum(["fixed", "variable"]),
    value: z.number().optional(),
    min: z.number().optional(),
    max: z.number().optional(),
  }),
  stripeAccountId: z.string(),
  collectReceiptEmail: z.boolean().default(false),
  validation: ZValidation.optional(),
});

export type TSurveyPaymentElement = z.infer<typeof ZSurveyPaymentElement>;
```

Upon implementation, a `Payment` entry will also be added to the `TSurveyElementTypeEnum` in `packages/types/surveys/constants.ts`, which currently defines 15 element types and does not include a Payment type.

<Note>This schema is a planned specification. The actual implementation may differ. Source reference: `packages/types/surveys/elements.ts`</Note>

## API Request Example

The following JSON shows how a Payment question appears in a survey creation API payload:

```json
{
  "id": "payment_q1",
  "type": "payment",
  "headline": { "default": "Complete your payment" },
  "subheader": { "default": "Secure payment processed via Stripe" },
  "required": true,
  "currency": "usd",
  "amount": {
    "type": "fixed",
    "value": 2999
  },
  "stripeAccountId": "acct_1234567890",
  "collectReceiptEmail": true
}
```

This payload structure follows the conventions established by other element types in the Formbricks survey schema. For the complete API reference, see the [API v1 Reference](/api-reference) or [API v2 Reference](/api-v2-reference).
