When a user doesn't convert, you want to know why. A micro-survey displayed at exactly the right time gives you a window into understanding the most relevant question: To pay or not to pay?

## Purpose

Understanding why free users don’t convert to paid users helps boost revenue. This insight allows you to adjust your offering to encourage more users to upgrade.

## Formbricks Approach

- Ask at exactly the right point in time.
- Ask to understand the problem, don’t ask for solutions.

## Installation

To display the Trial Conversion Survey in your app you want to proceed as follows:

- Create new Trial Conversion Survey at [app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com/).
- Set up the user action to display survey at right point in time.
- Print it.

<Note>
  Is the Formbricks SDK running? We assume you’ve already installed the Formbricks SDK in your web app, as it’s required to display messages and surveys. If not, follow the [Quick Start Guide (takes 15 mins max.)](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/quickstart).
</Note>

### 1. Create New Trial Conversion Survey

Save, and move over to the **Audience** tab.

### 3. Pre-Segment Your Audience

Pre-segmentation isn't needed for this survey since you likely want to target all users who cancel their trial. You can use a specific user action, like clicking **Cancel Trial**, to show the survey only to users trying your product.

### 4. Set Up A Trigger For The Trial Conversion Survey

How you trigger your survey depends on your product. There are two options:

- **Trigger by Page view:** If you have a page like `/trial-cancelled` for users who cancel their trial subscription, create a user action with the type "Page View." Select "Limit to specific pages" and apply URL filters with these settings:

![Add page URL action](/images/xm-and-surveys/xm/best-practices/improve-trial-cr/action-pageurl.webp)

Whenever a user visits this page, the survey will be displayed ✅

- **Trigger by Button Click:** In a different case, you have a “Cancel Trial" button in your app. You can setup a user Action with the `Inner Text`:

Please have a look at our complete [Actions manual](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/actions) if you have questions.

### 5. Select Action In The “When To Ask” Card
