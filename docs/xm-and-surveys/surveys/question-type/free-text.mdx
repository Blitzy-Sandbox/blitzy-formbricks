Free text questions (internally referred to as **OpenText** elements) allow respondents to enter a custom answer. Displays a title and an input field for the respondent to type in.

## Elements

![Overview of Free Text question type](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/question-type/free-text.webp)

### Title

Add a clear title to inform the respondent what information you are asking for. This maps to the `headline` field in the survey element schema and supports internationalization (I18n) for multi-language surveys.

### Description

Provide an optional description with further instructions. The description field (internally `subheader`) supports rich text formatting and is useful for adding context or guidance beneath the main title.

### Placeholder

Specify a placeholder text to display in the input field. The placeholder supports internationalization (I18n), so you can provide locale-specific placeholder text for multi-language surveys.

### Input Type

Choose the type of input field to display. The `inputType` setting determines both the validation applied to the response and the keyboard layout shown on mobile devices. The five available input types are:

- **Text** — Standard free-text input for open-ended responses. By default this renders as a multi-line textarea (long answer). You can toggle the _"Long answer"_ switch at the bottom of the question segment to convert it to a single-line input field.
- **Email** — A single-line text input that validates the response as a properly formatted email address.
- **URL** — A single-line text input that validates the response as a properly formatted URL.
- **Number** — A single-line text input that accepts only numeric values. Displays increment and decrement buttons for convenience. When this input type is selected, additional numeric validation rules become available (see [Validation Rules](#validation-rules) below).
- **Phone** — A single-line text input that validates the response as a phone number format.

<Note>
The input type affects the virtual keyboard shown on mobile devices. For example, selecting **Email** presents an email-optimized keyboard with the `@` symbol readily accessible, while **Number** shows a numeric keypad.
</Note>

### Character Limits

You can configure minimum and maximum character limits for free text responses using the character limit settings. When enabled, a character counter is displayed in the input field to give respondents real-time feedback on their input length.

To configure character limits:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Character Limits">
    Toggle the character limit option on within the question configuration.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Minimum (Optional)">
    Specify the minimum number of characters required. The respondent must enter at least this many characters to submit their response.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Set Maximum (Optional)">
    Specify the maximum number of characters allowed. The respondent cannot exceed this character count.
  </Step>
</Steps>

| Parameter | Type | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `enabled` | Boolean | Whether character limits are active. Defaults to `false`. |
| `min` | Number (optional) | Minimum number of characters required. Must be a positive number. |
| `max` | Number (optional) | Maximum number of characters allowed. Must be a positive number. |

<Note>
When character limits are enabled, at least one of `min` or `max` must be specified. If both are set, the minimum value cannot exceed the maximum value.
</Note>

### Long Answer

The **Long Answer** toggle controls whether the input field renders as a multi-line textarea or a single-line input:

- **Enabled (default for Text input type)** — Renders a multi-line textarea, ideal for longer open-ended responses such as feedback, comments, or detailed descriptions.
- **Disabled** — Renders a single-line input field, suitable for short answers like names, titles, or brief phrases.

<Note>
The Long Answer toggle is only relevant when the input type is set to **Text**. Other input types (Email, URL, Number, Phone) always render as single-line fields.
</Note>

## Validation Rules

Free Text (OpenText) elements support the most comprehensive set of validation rules among all question types. You can combine multiple rules using **AND** or **OR** logic to create precise input requirements.

### Text And String Rules

The following validation rules apply to all input types:

| Rule | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `minLength` | Requires a minimum number of characters | `min` (number) — Minimum character count |
| `maxLength` | Limits the maximum number of characters | `max` (number) — Maximum character count |
| `pattern` | Validates against a regular expression pattern | `pattern` (string) — Regex pattern; `flags` (string, optional) — Regex flags |
| `email` | Validates that the input is a properly formatted email address | None |
| `url` | Validates that the input is a properly formatted URL | None |
| `phone` | Validates that the input is a properly formatted phone number | None |
| `equals` | Requires the input to exactly match a specific value | `value` (string) — The expected value |
| `doesNotEqual` | Requires the input to not match a specific value | `value` (string) — The excluded value |
| `contains` | Requires the input to contain a specific substring | `value` (string) — The required substring |
| `doesNotContain` | Requires the input to not contain a specific substring | `value` (string) — The excluded substring |

### Numeric Rules

The following validation rules are available exclusively when the input type is set to **Number**:

| Rule | Description | Parameters |
|------|-------------|------------|
| `minValue` | Sets a minimum numeric value for the response | `min` (number) — Minimum allowed value |
| `maxValue` | Sets a maximum numeric value for the response | `max` (number) — Maximum allowed value |
| `isGreaterThan` | Requires the numeric response to exceed a threshold | `min` (number) — Threshold value (exclusive) |
| `isLessThan` | Requires the numeric response to be below a threshold | `max` (number) — Threshold value (exclusive) |

<Warning>
Numeric validation rules (`minValue`, `maxValue`, `isGreaterThan`, `isLessThan`) are only applicable when the input type is set to **Number**. They will not appear as options for other input types.
</Warning>

### Combining Rules

You can add multiple validation rules to a single Free Text element and choose how they are evaluated:

- **AND logic (default)** — The response must satisfy **all** rules to be accepted.
- **OR logic** — The response must satisfy **at least one** rule to be accepted.

This allows you to build complex validation scenarios. For example, you could require a response that is between 10 and 500 characters long and contains the word "feedback", or validate that a numeric input falls within a specific range.
