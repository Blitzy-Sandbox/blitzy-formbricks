Formbricks provides comprehensive user management capabilities to help you control access, organize teams, and secure your organization. This section covers everything you need to know about managing users, roles, and permissions.

## Key concepts

Formbricks uses a flexible permission system with multiple layers:

- **Organization roles** - Control access across the entire organization
- **Team roles** - Provide granular permissions within specific teams
- **Project permissions** - Fine-tune access to individual projects
- **Security features** - Protect accounts with two-factor authentication

<Note>
  Advanced user management features are part of the [Enterprise Edition](/self-hosting/advanced/license). The Community Edition and Free/Startup Cloud plans support unlimited organization members with Owner permissions.

## Workspace Governance

Formbricks implements a multi-layered governance model that enforces clear organizational boundaries, environment separation, and granular access control. The hierarchy follows an **Organization → Project → Team → Role** structure, where each layer provides progressively finer control over resources and permissions.

### Organization

The **Organization** is the top-level entity in Formbricks. It contains all memberships, projects, teams, invites, billing configuration, and API keys. Self-hosting instances typically have a single organization, while Formbricks Cloud supports multi-tenancy with multiple organizations.

### Project

A **Project** lives within an Organization and serves as the primary grouping mechanism for surveys and related resources. Each project contains exactly two **Environments** — `production` and `development` — enforcing strict separation between testing and live operations.

Source: `apps/web/modules/projects/`

### Team

**Teams** enable group-based access control for subsets of organization members. Teams are linked to projects through project team assignments, each with a specific permission level (`read`, `readWrite`, or `manage`).

<Note>
  Teams and team-based access control are part of the [Enterprise Edition](/self-hosting/advanced/license).

### Organization Roles

The **OrganizationRole** enum defines four distinct roles with increasing levels of access. These roles are assigned through memberships and control what actions a user can perform across the organization.

| Role | Access Level | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `owner` | Full administrative | Complete control over the organization including billing, member management, project creation, and all settings |
| `manager` | Management-level | Manage projects, teams, surveys, and organization settings; cannot modify billing or transfer ownership |
| `member` | Standard access | Access assigned projects and surveys; cannot manage teams or organization settings |
| `billing` | Billing-only | View and manage billing configuration; cannot access projects, surveys, or organization settings |

### API Key Management

Formbricks provides per-environment API keys managed through organization settings. Each key is scoped to specific environments with granular permission levels (`read`, `write`, or `manage`), enabling fine-grained programmatic access control.

## Typeform Workspace Comparison

Formbricks and Typeform take different structural approaches to workspace governance. Formbricks uses an **Organization → Project → Team** model with enforced environment separation, while Typeform uses a **Workspace → Team → Folder** model with flexible content hierarchy. Despite these structural differences, Formbricks achieves full governance parity — and exceeds Typeform in role granularity and environment isolation.

| Feature | Typeform | Formbricks | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| Top-level entity | Workspace | Organization | ✅ Full |
| Sub-organization grouping | Team | Team (Enterprise) | ✅ Full (EE) |
| Content organization | Folder hierarchy | Project → Environment | 🟡 Different model |
| Role types | Owner, Admin, Member (3) | owner, manager, member, billing (4) | ✅ Full+ |
| API key management | ✅ | ✅ (per-environment) | ✅ Full |
| Environment separation | — | Production and Development per project | ✅ Formbricks-only |
| Billing governance | Per-workspace limits | Per-organization limits | ✅ Full |
