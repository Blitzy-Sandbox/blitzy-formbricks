### Title

Add a clear title to inform the respondent what information you are asking for. This maps to the `headline` field in the survey schema and supports multi-language translations.

### Description

Provide an optional description with further instructions. This maps to the optional `subheader` field and also supports multi-language translations.

### Scale

Select the display mode to be used for the rating scale. There are four visual styles available:

| Display Mode | Value | Description |
|-------------|-------|-------------|
| **Star** | `star` | Star icons that fill based on selection (default) |
| **Smiley** | `smiley` | Smiley face emoticons representing satisfaction levels |
| **Number** | `number` | Numeric buttons displayed as labels |
| **Heart** | `heart` | Heart icons for sentiment-based ratings |

Each display mode provides a different visual representation but collects the same underlying numeric data.

### Range

Select the range of the rating scale. The supported ranges are: 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, or 10. The default is 5. Respondents select a value from 1 up to the selected range number.

### Labels

Add labels for the lower and upper bounds of the rating scale:

- **Lower Label** (`lowerLabel`) — Displayed beneath the lowest rating value (e.g., "Not satisfied")
- **Upper Label** (`upperLabel`) — Displayed beneath the highest rating value (e.g., "Very satisfied")

Both labels support multi-language translations for internationalized surveys. The defaults are "Not good" and "Very good".

### Color Coding

Enable the `isColorCodingEnabled` option to apply visual color cues to the rating scale. When enabled, rating values are color-coded from red (low) to green (high), providing immediate visual feedback about the sentiment of the selected value.

This option is disabled by default.

<Note>Color coding works with all four display modes (star, smiley, number, heart) and helps respondents intuitively understand the sentiment associated with each rating value.</Note>

## Response Format

The response for a rating question is always a single numeric value within the selected range (1 to the maximum range value). There are no additional validation rules — the respondent simply selects one value from the scale.

## CSAT Summary

After collecting responses, rating questions display a CSAT (Customer Satisfaction) score with a visual traffic light indicator to help you quickly assess satisfaction levels:

- 🟢 **Green** (> 80%): High satisfaction - your users are very satisfied
- 🟠 **Orange** (55-80%): Moderate satisfaction - there's room for improvement
- 🔴 **Red** (< 55%): Low satisfaction - immediate attention needed

<Note>The traffic light indicator appears automatically in the survey summary view, giving you instant feedback on user satisfaction without needing to dig into the data.</Note>

### How CSAT Is Calculated

The CSAT percentage represents the proportion of respondents who gave a "satisfied" rating. The formula is:

**CSAT Score = (Number of Satisfied Responses / Total Responses) × 100**

What counts as "satisfied" depends on your selected range:

| Range | Satisfied Ratings | Examples |
|-------|------------------|----------|
| 3 | Highest rating only | ⭐⭐⭐ |
| 4 | Top 2 ratings | ⭐⭐⭐ or ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 5 | Top 2 ratings | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ or ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| 6 | Top 2 ratings | 5 or 6 |
| 7 | Top 2 ratings | 6 or 7 |
| 10 | Top 3 ratings | 8, 9, or 10 |

<Note>
**Pro Tip:** For most use cases, a 5-point scale with star or smiley icons provides the best balance between granularity and user experience. Users find it easy to understand and quick to complete.
