## Types of Variables

There are two types of variables you can add to your survey:

1. **Text** — Captures text data. Supports the following operators:
   - `assign`: Sets the variable to a specific text value
   - `concat`: Appends text to the existing variable value

2. **Number** — Captures numeric data. Supports the following operators:
   - `assign`: Sets the variable to a specific numeric value
   - `add`: Adds a value to the current variable
   - `subtract`: Subtracts a value from the current variable
   - `multiply`: Multiplies the current variable by a value
   - `divide`: Divides the current variable by a value

<Note>
  Division by zero is prevented at the validation level. If you attempt to divide a number variable by a static value of zero, the survey editor will display a validation error.
</Note>

## How to Add Variables

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open the Variables Section">
    Edit the survey you want to add variables to, switch to the **Questions** tab, and scroll down to the bottom of the page. You will see a section called **Variables**.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Add a New Variable">
    Click on it to add a new variable ID. You can add as many variables as you want. Choose the type of variable (Text or Number) along with the default value.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Use Cases

- **Quiz**: You can use variables to create a quiz. For example, add a `score` number variable and update it every time a user answers a question correctly using the `add` operator. You can also recall the variable to show the final score to the user.

- **Personalisation**: You can use variables to store user data and personalise the survey experience. For example, add a `full_name` text variable and update it using the `concat` operator as the user fills in their first name and last name. Use the variable to personalise the survey by addressing the user with their full name.

## Differences From Hidden Fields

Variables are different from hidden fields in the following ways:

| Feature | Variables | Hidden Fields |
|---------|-----------|---------------|
| **Setting** | Set during creation or dynamically by using logic actions | Set through URL query parameters or the `formbricks.init` SDK call |
| **Updating** | Can be updated while the user fills the survey | Set once and cannot be changed during the survey |
| **Type** | Support both **text** and **number** data types | Only store **text** data |

## How to Use Variables

<Steps>
  <Step title="Access Variables in the Logic Editor">
    Once you have added variables to your survey, you can access them in the logic editor. Variables can be used as condition sources (left operand) to create logic conditions, and they can be modified via the `calculate` action.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Create Logic With Variables">
    You can create logic based on the variables and questions in your survey and update the variables based on the user's response. Variables interact with questions and hidden fields in logic conditions.

### Recalling Variables in the Survey

You can recall the variable value and display it to the respondent by using the [Recall Data](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/recall) function. Type `@` in any question text or description field to see a dropdown of available variables, hidden fields, and previous question answers.
