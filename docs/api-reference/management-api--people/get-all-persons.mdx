openapi: get /api/v1/management/people
---

<Warning>
  The People API endpoints are maintained for backward compatibility. In newer versions of Formbricks, the terminology has shifted from "People" to "Contacts." For new integrations, consider using the [Contacts API](/api-reference/management-api--contacts/get-all-contacts) instead.
</Warning>

## Endpoint Details

This endpoint retrieves all identified people from your Formbricks environment. The response includes pagination support for large datasets.

### Authentication

This endpoint requires a valid API key passed via the `x-api-key` header with appropriate read permissions. See [Generate API Key](/api-reference/generate-key) for setup instructions.

### Pagination

The response includes pagination metadata. Use the returned offset and limit values to paginate through large result sets.

<Note>
  This endpoint returns identified people only — anonymous visitors are not included in the results. Each person object includes their internal Formbricks ID, creation timestamp, and associated attributes.
