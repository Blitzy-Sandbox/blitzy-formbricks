Add new members to your Formbricks organization to collaborate on surveys and manage projects together. You can invite members individually or in bulk using CSV uploads.

## Prerequisites

To invite members, you need:

- **Owner** or **Manager** role in the organization
- Valid email addresses for the people you want to invite

## Individual Invitations

Use this method when inviting a few people or when you need to carefully control each invitation.

### Steps To Invite Individual Members

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate To Organization Members">
    Go to the organization settings page and click on the "Access Control" tab.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter Member Email">
    Click the `Add member` button to open the invitation modal.
    ![Add member Button Position](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/access-roles/add-member.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select Role">
    In the modal, add the Name, Email and Role of the organization member you want to invite. Available roles: **Owner**, **Manager**, **Member**, **Billing**.

  </Step>
  <Step title="Send Invitation">
    Click the invite button to send the invitation email.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### What Happens Next

1. Formbricks sends an email to the member with an invitation link
2. The member clicks the link — if they already have an account, they join the organization; if not, they can create a new account
3. Once accepted, they have access based on the role assigned during invitation

## Bulk Invitations

Use bulk invitations when you need to invite many people at once, such as when onboarding an entire team or department.

### Steps To Invite Members In Bulk

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate To Organization Settings">
    Go to the organization settings page and click on the "Access Control" tab.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Start The Bulk Invitation Process">
    Click on the `Add member` button:

    ![Add member Button Position](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/access-roles/add-member.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Switch To Bulk Invite">
    In the modal, switch to `Bulk Invite`. You can download an example CSV file by clicking the "Download CSV template" button. The template file is named `formbricks-organization-members-template.csv`.

    ![Bulk Invite Modal Tab](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/access-roles/bulk-invite.webp)
  </Step>
  <Step title="Prepare Your CSV File">
    The CSV file uses the following column headers (mapped internally via the `transformHeader` function):

    | CSV Column Header | Internal Field | Description |
    | ----------------- | -------------- | ----------- |
    | **Full Name**     | `name`         | Full name of the person |
    | **Email Address** | `email`        | Valid email address |
    | **Role**          | `role`         | One of: Owner, Manager, Member, Billing |

    Example CSV content:

    ```csv
    Full Name,Email Address,Role
    Jane Doe,jane@example.com,Manager
    John Smith,john@example.com,Member
    Alice Lee,alice@example.com,Owner
    ```

    {/* Source: apps/web/modules/organization/settings/teams/components/invite-member/bulk-invite-tab.tsx */}
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload And Send Invitations">
    Upload the filled CSV file and click the invite button to send invitations in bulk.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  When access control is not available (Community Edition, **Free**, or **Startup** plans), all bulk-invited members are assigned the **Owner** role regardless of the role specified in the CSV file.
</Note>

<Note>
  On self-hosted instances (non-cloud), the **Billing** role is automatically converted to **Owner** since billing management is not applicable outside the cloud environment.

  {/* Source: apps/web/modules/organization/settings/teams/components/invite-member/bulk-invite-tab.tsx */}
</Note>

### What Happens Next

- Formbricks sends an invitation email to each organization member listed in the CSV
- Each member can accept the invitation or create a new account by clicking the invitation link
- All invitations are processed simultaneously
- Invitations are validated before sending — invalid entries (e.g., malformed email addresses or missing fields) will display an error and will not be sent

## Role Assignment During Invitation

The role for each member is selected at invitation time, for both individual and bulk invitations. The four available organization roles are:

- **Owner** — Full organizational control including billing, integrations, and member management
- **Manager** — Management access to teams and projects, can invite members (as Member role only)
- **Member** — Basic access to assigned projects and teams
- **Billing** — Billing and payment management only (cloud environments)

After a member joins the organization, their role can be changed by an Owner or Manager from the **Organization Settings > Access Control** page.

### Privilege Escalation Prevention

To maintain security, role assignment follows strict escalation rules:

- **Owners** can assign any role up to Owner level
- **Managers** can only assign the **Member** role — they cannot escalate users to Manager or Owner
- **Members** cannot invite or assign roles

For a detailed breakdown of all role permissions, see [Organizations And Roles](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/user-management/organizations-and-roles).

## Managing Pending Invitations

All pending invitations are visible in **Organization Settings > Access Control**. From this page, you can view, resend, or revoke invitations.

### View Pending Invitations

- All pending invitations are listed alongside current organization members in the Access Control tab
- Each invitation displays the invitee name, email address, assigned role, and the date the invitation was sent

### Resend Invitation Emails

- If an invitation has not been accepted, it can be resent from the Access Control page
- This is useful when the original invitation email was lost, filtered to spam, or has expired

### Revoke Pending Invitations

- Cancel a pending invitation at any time before it has been accepted
- Once revoked, the invitation link becomes invalid and the invitee can no longer use it to join the organization

### Invitation Status

Monitor the status of each invitation:

| Status       | Description |
| ------------ | ----------- |
| **Pending**  | Invitation sent but not yet accepted by the recipient |
| **Accepted** | The user has joined the organization and is now an active member |
| **Expired**  | The invitation has expired and must be resent to remain valid |
