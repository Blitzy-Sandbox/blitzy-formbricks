title: "User Metadata"
description: "Formbricks captures metadata of your users for you when they fill a survey. This metadata is useful for understanding the context in which the user filled the survey. For example, if you are running a marketing campaign, you can understand which source is driving the most responses. Or if you are running a survey on a specific page, you can understand the user's behavior on that page."

## Metadata Captured

Formbricks automatically collects the following metadata fields for each survey response:

- **Source**: The source from where the user filled the survey. This could be an App, Link, or a Webpage.

- **URL**: The URL of the page where the user filled the survey.

- **Browser**: The browser used by the user to fill the survey (e.g., Chrome, Firefox, Safari).

- **OS**: The operating system of the device used by the user to fill the survey (e.g., Windows, macOS, Linux, iOS, Android).

- **Device**: The device used by the user to fill the survey (e.g., mobile, tablet, or PC / Generic device).

- **Country**: The country of the user, determined from their connection.

- **Action**: The action that triggered the survey. This is only available for App surveys.

- **IP Address**: The IP address of the respondent. This field is only captured when the **Capture IP Address** toggle is enabled in the survey's response options. It is hidden by default to respect user privacy.

- **Language**: The language in which the respondent completed the survey. This is displayed when a multi-language survey is used and the respondent selects a non-default language.

## Export Metadata

You can export the metadata of your responses along with the response data. When you export responses, you will see the metadata fields (Source, URL, Browser, OS, Device, Country, Action, IP Address, and Language) included as columns in the exported CSV file.

## Metadata In Analytics And Reporting

Metadata plays a key role in analyzing survey results and understanding respondent behavior:

- **Source Analysis**: Identify which distribution channels (App, Link, or Webpage) drive the most survey responses, helping you optimize your outreach strategy.
- **Device and Browser Insights**: Understand which devices and browsers your respondents use, ensuring your surveys render correctly across all platforms.
- **Geographic Breakdown**: Use the Country field to segment responses by region for localized insights.
- **Action Tracking**: For App surveys, the Action field reveals which in-app triggers generate the highest response rates.

## Custom Metadata With Hidden Fields

Formbricks captures the metadata fields listed above automatically. If you need to attach additional custom data to responses (such as a user ID, payment plan, or internal reference), use [Hidden Fields](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/hidden-fields) instead. Hidden fields allow you to pass custom key-value pairs with each survey submission without requiring the respondent to fill them in manually.
