## How To Add Hidden Fields

<Steps>
  <Step title="Enable Hidden Fields">
    Edit the survey you want to add hidden fields to and switch to the **Questions** tab. Scroll down to the bottom of the page where you will see a section called **Hidden Fields**. Enable it by toggling the switch.

  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Hidden Field IDs">
    Click on the hidden fields section to add a new hidden field ID. You can add as many hidden fields as you want. Each hidden field requires a unique identifier that you will use to pass data via URL parameters or the SDK.

  </Step>
</Steps>

## Set Hidden Field Via URL

You can pass values to hidden fields by appending them as query parameters to your survey link. The parameter name must match the hidden field ID you configured in the survey editor.

**Single Hidden Field:**

```text
https://formbricks.com/s/clin34bjy?screen=pricing
```

**Multiple Hidden Fields:**

```text
https://formbricks.com/s/clin34bjy?screen=landing_page&job=Founder
```

## Set Hidden Fields Via SDK

<Note>
  The hidden fields SDK integration is being reworked — the approach is moving from binding hidden fields to Actions over to Context. Until then, the current approach below **continues to be supported for the JS SDK**. However, hidden fields are **not supported** for the Android and iOS SDKs.
</Note>

You can pass hidden field values programmatically when tracking an action using the `formbricks.track()` method:

```js
formbricks.track("my_action_code", {
  hiddenFields: {
    myField: "value",
    anotherField: "anotherValue",
  },
});
```

The `hiddenFields` property accepts a `Record<string, string | number | string[]>`, allowing you to pass string, numeric, or array values for each hidden field.

## View Hidden Fields In Responses

Hidden fields are visible in the responses tab just like other fields — both in the **Summary** view and in the individual **Response Cards**. You can use them to filter and analyze your responses.

## Use Cases

- **Source Tracking**: Add a hidden field to track the source of the survey. For a detailed guide on source tracking, check out the [Source Tracking](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/link-surveys/source-tracking) guide.

- **User Metadata**: Capture user metadata such as user ID, email, or any other user-specific information without requiring the respondent to enter it manually.

- **Survey Metadata**: Capture contextual metadata such as the screen from which the survey was filled, the current app version, or any other application-specific information.
