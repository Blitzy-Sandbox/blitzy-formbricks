Matrix questions present a grid of rows and columns where respondents select one value per row using radio buttons. Rows represent the items or statements being evaluated, and columns represent the scale options or response values — both are fully customizable with user-defined labels.

## Elements

![Overview of Matrix question type](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/question-type/matrix.webp)

### Title

Add a clear title to inform the respondent what information you are asking for.

### Description

Provide an optional description with further instructions.

### Rows

Define the options shown on the left side of the matrix. Each row represents an item or statement that the respondent evaluates by selecting one of the column values. Rows are stored as an array of internationalized (I18n) string labels, so they support multi-language surveys.

### Columns

Define the scale options displayed along the top of the matrix. Each column represents a response value that respondents can select for any row. Columns are user-defined labels (not limited to numeric ranges) and are stored as an array of internationalized (I18n) strings, allowing full customization for any rating scale, agreement level, frequency, or other evaluation criteria.

### Select Ordering

Control how rows are presented to each respondent using the `shuffleOption` setting:

- **Keep current order** (`none`): Rows appear in the order they were added. This is the default behavior.
- **Randomize all** (`all`): All rows are randomized for each respondent, reducing order bias.
- **Randomize except last** (`exceptLast`): All rows are randomized except the last one, which remains in its fixed position. This is useful when the last row serves as a summary or "other" option.

## Validation Rules

Matrix elements support validation rules to ensure data completeness. You can configure these in the survey editor to require respondents to answer a specific number of rows before proceeding.

| Rule | Description | Parameters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Answer All Rows** (`answerAllRows`) | Requires respondents to provide an answer for every row in the matrix. | None |
| **Minimum Rows Answered** (`minRowsAnswered`) | Requires a minimum number of rows to be answered before the respondent can proceed. | `min` (number, must be ≥ 1) |

<Note>
  When multiple validation rules are applied, they are combined using the configured logic operator (`and` or `or`). By default, rules are combined with `and`, meaning all conditions must be satisfied.
</Note>

## Response Data Format

Matrix responses are stored as a JSON object where each key is the row label and each value is the selected column label for that row.

```json
{
  "Customer Service": "Satisfied",
  "Product Quality": "Very Satisfied",
  "Delivery Speed": "Neutral"
}
```

Rows that the respondent did not answer are omitted from the response object. If validation rules require all rows to be answered, every row label will appear as a key in the response.
