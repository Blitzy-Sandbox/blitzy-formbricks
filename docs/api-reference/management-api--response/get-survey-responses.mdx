## Response Data Structure

Response data is keyed by question IDs. Each response object contains the survey answers mapped to their respective question identifiers:

```json
{
  "clx1234abcdef": "User's answer to this question",
  "clx5678ghijkl": ["Option A", "Option B"]
}
```

## Filtering And Pagination

- Pass `surveyId` as a query parameter to filter responses for a specific survey
- Use `limit` and `skip` query parameters for pagination
- If no `surveyId` is provided, responses across all accessible environments are returned

## Partial Submissions

Responses with `finished: false` represent partial submissions where the respondent did not complete all questions. These are included in the response listing by default.
