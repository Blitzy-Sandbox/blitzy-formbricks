<Note>
  Nail down your survey first? Any changes in the survey cause additional work in the Zap. It makes sense to first settle on the survey you want to run and then get to setting up Zapier.
</Note>

## Step 1: Setup Your Survey Incl. `questionId` For Every Question

When setting up the Zap your life will be easier when you change the `questionId`s of your survey questions. You can only do so **before** you publish your survey.

![Update Question ID](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/zapier/update-question-id.webp)

*In every question card in the Advanced Settings you find the Question ID field. Update it so that you’ll recognize the response tied to this question.*

<Note>
  Already published? Duplicate survey You can only update the questionId
  when the survey was not yet published. Already published it? Just **duplicate
  it** to update the questionIds.

## Step 2: Send A Test Response

In order to set up Zapier you’ll need a test response. This allows you to select the individual values of each response in your Zap.

## Step 3: Setup Your Zap

Go to [zapier.com](https://zapier.com) and create a new Zap. Search for “Formbricks” to get started:

![Add New Zap](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/zapier/add-new-zap.webp)

Then, choose the event you want to trigger the Zap on:

![Choose Event](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/zapier/choose-event.webp)

## Step 4: Connect Formbricks With Zapier

Now, you have to connect Zapier with Formbricks via an API Key:

![Connect with Formbricks - 1](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/zapier/connect-with-formbricks-1.webp)

![Connect with Formbricks - 2](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/zapier/connect-with-formbricks-2.webp)

Now you need an API key. Please refer to the [API Key Setup](/api-reference/generate-key) page to learn how to create one.

Once you copied it in the newly opened Zapier window, you will be connected:

## Step 5: Select Survey

Next, you can choose from all the surveys you have created in this environment:

![Select Survey](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/zapier/select-survey.webp)

## Step 6: Test Your Trigger

Once you hit “Test” you will see the three most recent submissions for this survey. If you don’t have any submissions in the survey, submit one to continue setting up your Zap:

![Test Submission](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/zapier/test-submission.webp)

*Now you're happy that you updated the questionId's*

## Step 7: Set Up Your Zap

Now you have all the data you need at hand. The next steps depend on what you want to do with it. In this tutorial, we will send submissions to a Slack channel:

![Slack Channel Message](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/zapier/slack-channel-msg.webp)

In the action itself we can determine the data and layout of the message. Here, we only choose the submission data. You can also refer to the meta data of the submission and the [attributes](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/website-app-surveys/user-identification) of the person who submitted the survey.

![Slack Message](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/zapier/slack-message.webp)

We now receive a notification in our Slack channel whenever a Churn survey is completed:

## Data Mapping

When a survey response triggers your Zap, the Formbricks trigger delivers the full webhook payload. Response data is keyed by each question's `questionId`, which is why setting meaningful question IDs in Step 1 is important for readability.

The payload contains the following top-level field groups:

| Field Group | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `data.*` | Survey response values keyed by `questionId` (e.g., `data.satisfaction`, `data.feedback`) |
| `meta.country` | The country from which the response was submitted |
| `meta.userAgent` | Browser and operating system information of the respondent |
| `survey.title` | The name of the survey that received the response |
| `survey.type` | The survey distribution type (e.g., `link` or `app`) |

Use these fields in subsequent Zapier action steps to route and transform data. For example, you can map `data.*` fields to columns in a Google Sheet, include `survey.title` in a Slack notification message, or filter Zaps based on `meta.country`.

<Note>
  The available trigger events are `responseCreated`, `responseUpdated`, and `responseFinished`. Choose the event that best fits your workflow — `responseFinished` fires only when all required questions are answered and the survey is submitted.
