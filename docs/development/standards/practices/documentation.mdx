## Overview

At Formbricks, we maintain strict documentation standards to ensure code clarity, maintainability, and ease of use for both internal developers and external contributors.

### Contribute to Documentation

We use Mintlify to maintain our documentation. You can find more information about how to contribute to the documentation in the [README](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/main/docs/README.md) file.

## Code Documentation

### Function Documentation

1. **Complex Logic Documentation**
   - All functions with complex logic must include JSDoc comments
   - Document parameters, return types, and potential side effects
   - Example:

```typescript
/**
Creates a new user and initializes their preferences
@param {string} name - User's full name
@param {UserOptions} options - Configuration options for user creation
@returns {Promise<User>} The created user object
@throws {ValidationError} If name is invalid
*/
async function createUser(name: string, options: UserOptions): Promise<User> {
  // implementation
}
```

2. **TypeScript Ignore Comments**
   - When using `@ts-ignore` or `@ts-expect-error`, always include a comment explaining why
   - Example:

```typescript
// @ts-expect-error -- Required for dynamic function calls
void window.formbricks.setup(...args);
```

### API Documentation

1. **API Endpoints**

   - All new API endpoints must be documented in the OpenAPI specification
   - Include request/response schemas, authentication requirements, and examples
   - Document both Client API and Management API endpoints
   - Place API documentation in the `docs/api-reference` directory

2. **Authentication**
   - Clearly specify authentication requirements
   - Document API key usage and permissions
   - Include error scenarios and handling

### Feature Documentation

- All new features must include a feature documentation file
- Document the feature's purpose, usage, and implementation details
- Include code examples and best practices

## Authoritative Documentation Standards

The `AGENTS.md` file at the repository root is the authoritative source for documentation standards across the Formbricks codebase. All documentation contributors must follow these rules:

- Add frontmatter with `title`, `description`, and `icon` at the top of every MDX file — all three fields are **required**
- Do not start with an H1 heading — Mintlify generates the H1 automatically from the frontmatter `title`
- Use Camel Case headings throughout (only capitalize the feature name, e.g., "## Set Up your first Survey" not "## SET UP YOUR FIRST SURVEY")
- Use Mintlify components for steps and callouts (see the [Mintlify Components](#mintlify-components) section below)
- If a page documents an Enterprise-only feature, add the Enterprise note block (see [Enterprise Feature Annotations](#enterprise-feature-annotations) below)

> Source: `AGENTS.md` — Documentation (apps/docs) section

## Working with Mintlify

We use [Mintlify](https://mintlify.com/docs) to build, preview, and deploy our documentation.

### File Format Requirements

All documentation files must adhere to the following format:

- Use the `.mdx` file extension for every documentation file
- Include frontmatter with `title` (in Camel Case), `description`, and `icon` — all three fields are **required** on every page
- Do not include an H1 heading in the file body — Mintlify generates it from the frontmatter `title`
- All content headings start at H2 (`##`) and use Camel Case

Example frontmatter block:

```yaml
---
title: "Document Title"
description: "Brief description of the content"
icon: "appropriate-icon"
---
```

### Navigation Configuration

The master navigation configuration lives in `docs/docs.json` (migrated from the legacy `mint.json` format via the `mintlify upgrade` command).

<Note>
  The configuration file was renamed from `mint.json` to `docs.json` as part of the Mintlify platform migration. Always reference `docs/docs.json` — the legacy `mint.json` file no longer exists.
</Note>

Key details about navigation:

- `docs/docs.json` is a 760-line configuration file that defines the site theme, navigation tabs, redirects, analytics, and navbar
- The navigation is organized into **6 tabs**: Overview, XM & Surveys, Self Hosting, Development, API v1 Reference, and API v2 Reference (Beta)
- Every new MDX file **must** have a corresponding entry in the `docs.json` navigation structure
- When renaming or moving pages, add redirect entries to the `redirects` array in `docs.json` to preserve backward compatibility
- Follow the existing navigation hierarchy when adding new pages

### Mintlify Components

Use Mintlify components to create structured, visually consistent documentation. The following components are available:

**`<Note>` — Important information callouts:**

```mdx
<Note>
  Important information that readers should be aware of.
</Note>
```

**`<Warning>` — Critical warning callouts:**

```mdx
<Warning>
  Critical warning about potential issues or breaking changes.
</Warning>
```

**`<Steps>` — Sequential procedure steps:**

```mdx
<Steps>
  <Step title="First Step">
    Description of the first step.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Second Step">
    Description of the second step.
  </Step>
</Steps>
```

**`<Card>` — Navigation or content cards:**

```mdx
<Card title="Card Title" icon="icon-name" href="/path/to/page">
  Brief description of what this card links to.
</Card>
```

**`<CardGroup>` — Grouped card layouts for navigation:**

```mdx
<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="First Card" icon="icon-name" href="/path/to/first">
    First card description.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Second Card" icon="icon-name" href="/path/to/second">
    Second card description.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>
```

**`<Accordion>` — Collapsible content sections:**

```mdx
<Accordion title="Expandable Section Title">
  Content that is hidden by default and revealed on click.
</Accordion>
```

### Image Requirements

All documentation images must follow these standards for consistency and accessibility:

- Use `.webp` format for all images (consistent with the existing 393+ image assets in the repository)
- Store images in `docs/images/` subdirectories that mirror the documentation structure (e.g., `docs/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/slack/`)
- Include descriptive alt text on every image for accessibility compliance
- Example image syntax:

```mdx
![Descriptive alt text for the screenshot](/images/section/feature/screenshot.webp)
```

### Internal Link Format

Use relative paths **without** file extensions for all internal documentation links:

```mdx
<!-- Correct -->
[Docker Setup](/self-hosting/setup/docker)

<!-- Incorrect — do not include .mdx extension -->
[Docker Setup](self-hosting/setup/docker.mdx)

<!-- Incorrect — do not use absolute URLs for internal links -->
[Docker Setup](https://formbricks.com/docs/self-hosting/setup/docker)
```

### Enterprise Feature Annotations

Pages that document Enterprise-only features (SSO, audit logging, team access, billing, quotas, multi-language surveys, whitelabel, contacts and segments, email follow-ups, insights) must include an Enterprise license annotation at the top of the content:

```mdx
<Note>
  This feature requires an Enterprise License. [Learn more about Enterprise features](/self-hosting/advanced/enterprise-features).
</Note>
```

Place this annotation immediately after the frontmatter block and before the first content heading.

### Content Guidelines

1. **Writing Style**
   - Use clear, concise language accessible to developers and product managers
   - Break content into logical sections with proper Camel Case headings
   - Include practical examples and code snippets
   - Follow progressive disclosure: simple concepts first, advanced configurations later

2. **Media and Assets**

   - Store images in the appropriate `docs/images/` subdirectory in `.webp` format
   - Use descriptive alt text for all images
   - Optimize images for web delivery
   - Use relative paths without file extensions for internal links

3. **Code Examples**
   - Specify the language identifier for all code blocks (e.g., `typescript`, `bash`, `yaml`, `json`, `mdx`)
   - Include comments for complex code snippets
   - Use proper indentation and formatting

## Validation

### Local Testing

Test documentation locally using the Mintlify CLI. Install the CLI globally and run the preview server from the `docs/` directory:

```bash
# Install Mintlify CLI globally
npm i -g mintlify

# Navigate to the docs folder and start the preview server
cd docs
mintlify dev
```

The documentation preview is available at `http://localhost:3000` by default. Use a custom port if needed:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

> Source: `docs/README.md` — Mintlify local development instructions

### Mintlify CLI Commands

The following CLI commands are available for documentation validation and maintenance:

| Command | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| `mintlify dev` | Start local documentation preview server (default port 3000) |
| `mintlify dev --port 3333` | Start preview on a custom port |
| `mint check-links` | Check for broken internal links |
| `mint check-links --check-anchors` | Check broken links including anchor references |
| `mint a11y` | Accessibility audit (contrast ratios, alt text compliance) |
| `mint openapi-check` | Validate OpenAPI specification files |
| `mint validate --strict` | Strict build validation for CI/CD (exits on warnings) |
| `mint rename` | Rename files and update all internal link references automatically |

### Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before merging documentation changes, run the following validation pipeline:

```bash
# Check for broken links
mint check-links

# Validate accessibility
mint a11y

# Strict validation (recommended for CI/CD)
mint validate --strict
```

### Review Process

- Documentation changes require peer review
- Verify all links and references work using `mint check-links`
- Ensure proper formatting and rendering via `mintlify dev`
- Confirm all code blocks have language identifiers

These documentation requirements ensure that our codebase remains maintainable, accessible, and well-documented for both current and future developers.
