<Note>This only works with an Ubuntu machine, so ensure the underlying OS is verified beforehand!</Note>

If you’re looking to quickly set up a production instance of Formbricks on an Ubuntu server, this guide is for you. Using a convenient shell script, you can install Docker and set up a complete, production-ready Formbricks deployment in just a few steps. The script takes care of all the dependencies and configuration for your server, including:

- **Formbricks** application container
- **PostgreSQL** database (pgvector:pg17 with vector search support)
- **Valkey** (Redis-compatible cache for sessions, rate limiting, and audit logging)
- **MinIO** (S3-compatible object storage for file uploads — configured automatically with a Traefik subdomain)
- **Traefik** reverse proxy with automatic SSL via Let’s Encrypt

<Note>
  This setup uses **Traefik** as a **reverse proxy**, essential for directing incoming traffic to the correct
  container and enabling secure internet access to Formbricks. Traefik is chosen for its simplicity and
  automatic SSL management via Let’s Encrypt.
</Note>

For other operating systems or a more customized installation, please refer to the advanced installation guide with [Docker](/self-hosting/setup/docker).

## What Gets Deployed

The one-click script provisions the following services via Docker Compose:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Formbricks" icon="browser">
    Survey and feedback application (`ghcr.io/formbricks/formbricks:latest`)
  </Card>
  <Card title="PostgreSQL" icon="database">
    Database with pgvector extension for vector search (`pgvector/pgvector:pg17`)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Valkey" icon="bolt">
    Redis-compatible cache for sessions, rate limiting, and audit logging
  </Card>
  <Card title="MinIO" icon="hard-drive">
    S3-compatible object storage for file uploads (optional, with automatic Traefik configuration)
  </Card>
  <Card title="Traefik" icon="shield-halved">
    Reverse proxy with automatic Let’s Encrypt SSL certificates
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

<Note>
  The script sources its Docker Compose configuration from
  [`docker/docker-compose.yml`](https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks/blob/stable/docker/docker-compose.yml)
  in the Formbricks repository. Source: `docker/formbricks.sh`
</Note>

### Requirements

- An Ubuntu Virtual Machine with SSH access.

- A custom domain with an **A record** pointing to your server.

- Ports **80** and **443** are open in your VM's Security Group, allowing Traefik to create an SSL certificate.

### Deployment

Run this command in your terminal:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/formbricks/formbricks/stable/docker/formbricks.sh -o formbricks.sh && chmod +x formbricks.sh && ./formbricks.sh install
```

### Script Prompts

During installation, the script will prompt you to provide some details:

- **Overwriting Docker GPG Keys**:
  If Docker GPG keys already exist, the script will ask whether you want to overwrite them.

🚗 Configuring Traefik...

```

- **File Upload Configuration**:
  The script will ask if you want to configure file uploads. If you skip this step, features like adding images to surveys, file upload question types, project logos, and custom organization logos in emails will be disabled.

```text
📁 Do you want to configure file uploads?
   If you skip this, the following features will be disabled:
   - Adding images to surveys (e.g., in questions or as background)
   - 'File Upload' and 'Picture Selection' question types
   - Project logos
   - Custom organization logo in emails
Configure file uploads now? [Y/n]
```

  If you choose `Y` (default), the script then asks whether to use an external S3-compatible storage or the bundled MinIO:

```text
🗄️  Do you want to use an external S3-compatible storage (AWS S3/DO Spaces/etc.)? [y/N]
```

  - **External S3 (`Y`)**: You will be prompted for your S3 Access Key, Secret Key, Region, Bucket Name, and Endpoint URL (leave the endpoint empty for AWS S3).
  - **Bundled MinIO (`N`, default)**: The script automatically configures a local MinIO instance with:
    - Auto-generated root and least-privilege service credentials
    - A dedicated `formbricks-uploads` bucket
    - A Traefik subdomain for MinIO access (e.g., `files.yourdomain.com`)
    - CORS configuration for your domain

  <Note>
    If you chose bundled MinIO, the script creates a `minio-init` service that runs once to configure the
    bucket and service user. See the [Cleanup MinIO Init](#cleanup-minio-init-optional) section below to
    optionally remove it after setup.
  </Note>

  If you decline file upload configuration entirely (`N` at the first prompt), file uploads are disabled and no S3/MinIO configuration is created.

**That's it**! After running the command and providing the required information, visit the domain name you entered, and you should see the Formbricks home wizard!

```

## Update

To update Formbricks, simply run the following command:

```bash
./formbricks.sh update
```

The script will automatically pull the latest version of Formbricks from GitHub Container Registry and restart the containers.

## Stop

To stop Formbricks, simply run the following command:

```bash
./formbricks.sh stop
```

The script will automatically stop all the Formbricks related containers and brings the entire stack down.

## Restart

To restart Formbricks, simply run the following command:

```bash
./formbricks.sh restart
```

The script will automatically restart all the Formbricks related containers and brings the entire stack up with the previous configuration.

## Cleanup MinIO Init (Optional)

During the one-click setup, a temporary `minio-init` service configures MinIO (bucket, policy, service user). It is idempotent and safe to leave in place; it will do nothing on subsequent starts once configuration exists.

If you prefer to remove the `minio-init` service and its references after a successful setup, run:

```bash
./formbricks.sh cleanup-minio-init
```

This only removes the init job and its Compose references; it does not delete any data or affect your MinIO configuration.

## Uninstall

To uninstall Formbricks, simply run the following command, but keep in mind that this will delete all your data!

```bash
./formbricks.sh uninstall
```

The script will automatically stop all the Formbricks related containers, remove the Formbricks directory, and delete the Docker network.

## Debug

If you encounter any issues, you can check the logs of the containers with:

```bash
./formbricks.sh logs
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues, consider the following steps:

- **Inbound Rules**: Make sure you have added inbound rules for Port 80 and 443 in your VM's Security Group.

- **A Record**: Verify that you have set up an A record for your domain, pointing to your VM's IP address.

- **Check Docker Instances**: Run `docker ps` to check the status of the Docker instances.

- **Check Formbricks Logs**: Run `cd formbricks && docker compose logs` to check the logs of the Formbricks stack.
