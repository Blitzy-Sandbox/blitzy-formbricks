<Note>
  Multi-language Surveys is an Enterprise Edition feature. You need an active [Enterprise License](/self-hosting/advanced/license) to use this feature.
</Note>

How to deliver a specific language depends on the survey type (app or link survey):

- **App & Website survey:** Set a `language` attribute for the user. [Read this guide for App Surveys](#app-surveys-configuration)

- **Link survey:** Add a `lang` parameter in the survey URL. [Read this guide for Link Surveys](#link-surveys-configuration)

## Supported Languages

Formbricks uses the ISO 639 standard for language identification and ships with **213 pre-configured language codes** covering a wide range of global languages and regional variants. Common examples include:

| Language | Code | Language | Code |
|----------|------|----------|------|
| English | `en` | Arabic | `ar` |
| German | `de` | Hindi | `hi` |
| French | `fr` | Japanese | `ja` |
| Spanish | `es` | Korean | `ko` |
| Portuguese | `pt` | Russian | `ru` |
| Dutch | `nl` | Chinese (Simplified) | `zh-Hans` |
| Italian | `it` | Chinese (Traditional) | `zh-Hant` |
| Polish | `pl` | Hebrew | `he` |

The full language list is available in the language selection dropdown when configuring your project languages. You can also assign **custom aliases** to any language code — for example, mapping `de` to `german` — to simplify URL parameters and SDK calls.

The admin interface displays language names localized in **14 interface locales**: English (en-US), German (de-DE), Portuguese (pt-BR, pt-PT), French (fr-FR), Chinese Traditional (zh-Hant-TW), Chinese Simplified (zh-Hans-CN), Romanian (ro-RO), Japanese (ja-JP), Dutch (nl-NL), Spanish (es-ES), Swedish (sv-SE), Russian (ru-RU), and Hungarian (hu-HU).

## Creating a Multi-language Survey

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Project Languages">
    Navigate to **Settings → Survey Languages** in your project configuration:

    ![Survey Configuration](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/multi-language-surveys/project-configuration.webp)

    Click on the **Edit languages** button to add a new language to your project.

    Select the preferred language from the dropdown and assign an identifier **Alias**. The alias is a short identifier (e.g., `de`, `fr`, `german`) used in SDK calls and URL parameters. Click the **Add language** button to add the language to your project:

    ![Add Multiple Languages to your Project](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/multi-language-surveys/add-languages.webp)

    You can come back to this page anytime to add more languages or remove existing ones.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create or Edit Your Survey">
    Return to the dashboard to create a new survey or edit an existing one:

    ![Survey Overview](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/multi-language-surveys/surveys-home.webp)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable Multi-language Support">
    In the survey editor, scroll down to the **Multiple Languages** section at the bottom and enable the toggle next to it:

    ![Enable Multi-language for a survey](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/multi-language-surveys/enable-multi-lang.webp)

    Choose a **Default Language** for your survey.

    <Warning>
      Changing the default language will reset all the translations you have made for the survey. Once set, the default language can only be changed by disabling the multi-language option and deleting all existing translations.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Add Supported Languages">
    Add the languages from the dropdown that you want to support in your survey:

    ![Add language in survey editor](/images/xm-and-surveys/surveys/general-features/multi-language-surveys/add-language-in-survey.webp)
  </Step>

  <Step title="Translate Survey Content">
    Click on the language dropdown in any question to switch the editor view to the selected language. Translate all survey content for each language, including:

    - **Question headlines and descriptions**
    - **Answer options and placeholders**
    - **Button labels** (Next, Back, Submit)
    - **Welcome card and thank-you card text**
    - **Validation error messages**

    Repeat this for every language you added. Any field left empty will fall back to the default language text.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish Your Survey">
    Once all translations are complete, click on the **Publish** button to save and activate the survey. Your survey is now available in all configured languages.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## App Surveys Configuration

For app and website surveys, the language is controlled via the Formbricks SDK using the `setLanguage` method.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Set Up Language for Users">
    After you set up the Formbricks SDK for your user, call the `setLanguage` function with the language code. This can be either the **ISO identifier** (e.g., `de`) or the **Alias** you assigned when adding the language to your project. The `language` attribute ensures that this user only sees surveys with a translation available in their specific language.

    ```js
    // Initialize the Formbricks SDK
    Formbricks.setup({
      environmentId: "<environment-id>",
      appUrl: "<app-url>", // use PUBLIC_URL for multi-domain setup, otherwise use WEBAPP_URL
    });

    // Set the user's preferred language
    Formbricks.setLanguage("de"); // ISO identifier or Alias set when creating language
    ```

    <Warning>
      If a user has a language assigned, and a survey has multi-language activated but is missing a translation in
      the language of the user, **the survey will not be displayed** to that user. Ensure all active surveys have translations for every language you plan to target.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Collecting Responses">
    Users with the language attribute set will now see surveys in their preferred language. You can start collecting responses in multiple languages and filter them by language on the summary page.

    To change a user's language at any time, call `setLanguage` again with a different language code:

    ```js
    Formbricks.setLanguage("fr"); // Switch to French
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

---

## Link Surveys Configuration

For link surveys, the translation delivery is controlled by the `lang` URL parameter appended to the survey link.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Publish Your Survey">
    After publishing the survey, copy the survey link from the share dialog.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Language-Specific URLs">
    Append the `lang` query parameter with the ISO language code or the alias you assigned. For example, if you have set the alias for French as `fr`, share the survey link as:

    ```bash
    https://your-survey-url.com?lang=fr
    ```

    Here are two examples:

    - **English:** `https://app.formbricks.com/s/clptfos2i1pj516pvhxqyu3bn?lang=en`
    - **German:** `https://app.formbricks.com/s/clptfos2i1pj516pvhxqyu3bn?lang=de`

    <Note>
      Without the `lang` parameter, Formbricks will show the survey in the **default language** you configured. This is useful when you want a single link that defaults to your primary language while allowing targeted links for specific audiences.
    </Note>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Collecting Responses">
    You can now start collecting responses in multiple languages! Distribute language-specific links to each audience segment.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## RTL Language Support

Formbricks fully supports Right-to-Left (RTL) languages. When you add an RTL language to your survey, the survey interface automatically adjusts to display content from right to left.

The following language codes are recognized as RTL: `ar`, `ar-SA`, `ar-EG`, `ar-AE`, `ar-MA`, `he`, `fa`, and `ur` — covering Arabic (and regional variants), Hebrew, Persian, and Urdu.

### How RTL Support Works

- **Text alignment** automatically switches to right-to-left
- **Survey layout** and UI elements adjust to RTL orientation
- **Button placement** and navigation flow adapt to RTL reading direction
- **Form elements** maintain proper RTL formatting
- **Language detection** is automatic — no extra configuration required

### Setting Up RTL Languages

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add RTL Language">
    Add an RTL language (such as Arabic or Hebrew) in the **Survey Languages** settings as described in the [Creating a Multi-language Survey](#creating-a-multi-language-survey) section above.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Translations">
    Create translations for your survey content in the RTL language. The editor will show the default LTR view, but the published survey will render RTL automatically.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Automatic RTL Display">
    The survey will automatically display in RTL format when that language is selected. No additional configuration is needed — direction detection is built in.

## Language Fallback Behavior

Understanding how Formbricks handles missing translations is important to ensure a smooth survey experience for your respondents.

### App and Website Surveys

- If a user has a language set via `Formbricks.setLanguage()` and the survey **does not have a translation** for that language, the survey **will not be displayed** to that user.
- If no language is set for the user, surveys without multi-language enabled will display in the default language.

### Link Surveys

- If the `?lang=` parameter is **not provided** in the URL, the survey displays in the **default language** configured in the survey editor.
- If the `?lang=` parameter specifies a language that **does not have a translation**, the survey falls back to the default language.

### Translation Defaults

- Any untranslated field within a language (e.g., a single question left blank) will display the **default language text** as a fallback.
- Changing the default language of a survey after translations have been created will **reset all existing translations**. This action requires confirmation and cannot be undone.

<Warning>
  Always double-check that all surveys targeted at a specific audience have complete translations for the intended language. Missing translations in app surveys will prevent the survey from being shown entirely.
</Warning>
