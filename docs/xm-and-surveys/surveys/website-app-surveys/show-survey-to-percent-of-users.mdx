To target specific segments of your audience or manage survey exposure, Formbricks allows you to display surveys to only a random selection of your targeted users.

## How to set up percentage-based visibility

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open settings in survey editor">
    In the Survey Editor, click on the **`Settings`** tab
  </Step>

  <Step title="Find 'Survey Trigger' card">
    Locate the 'Survey Trigger' card in the settings panel
  </Step>

  <Step title="Enable percentage toggle">
    Find and enable the **`Show Survey to % of Users`** toggle
  </Step>

  <Step title="Set percentage">
    Enter the desired percentage (from 0.01% to 100%) of users to whom the survey will be shown

  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  Please note that this feature operates based on mathematical probabilistic
  functions, which may result in slight variations in the exact percentage of
  users who see the survey.

## Understanding The displayPercentage Configuration

Under the hood, the percentage-based visibility is controlled by the `displayPercentage` property on each survey configuration:

| Property | Type | Range | Default | Location |
|----------|------|-------|---------|----------|
| `displayPercentage` | `number` | 0 to 100 | 100 (show to all targeted users) | Survey Settings → Survey Trigger card |

The `displayPercentage` value supports granularity down to **0.01%**, allowing fine-tuned control over survey exposure.

### How Random Sampling Works

Each time a user matches the survey's targeting criteria and a trigger fires, the Formbricks SDK generates a cryptographically secure random number and compares it against the configured `displayPercentage` value. If the random number falls at or below the threshold, the survey is displayed to that user.

Because the sampling is probabilistic and evaluated independently on each trigger event, slight statistical variations from the exact configured percentage are expected — especially at smaller sample sizes. As your sample size grows, the observed display rate converges closer to the configured value.

<Note>
  The random sampling uses `crypto.getRandomValues()` for cryptographically secure randomness, ensuring an even and unpredictable distribution across your user base.

### Example Usage

For instance, if you want to expose your survey to only half of your targeted user base, simply adjust the slider to show the survey to 50% of your users. This functionality allows you to conduct A/B testing or control the rollout of new surveys to gauge initial reactions before a wider release.

### Application

It's effective for:

* **A/B Testing**: Create two surveys with different questions or content and set each to 50% `displayPercentage` to evenly split your audience. Compare response patterns across both surveys to determine which version resonates better. You can also use unequal splits (e.g., 80/20) for more conservative experiments where you want to limit exposure to an untested variant.

* **Gradual Rollouts**: Start by setting `displayPercentage` to 10–20% to test a new survey with a small segment of your audience. Monitor response quality and completion rates, then gradually increase to 50% and eventually 100% as you gain confidence in the survey's effectiveness and user reception.

* **Load Management**: Manage server load and response processing by limiting the number of responses collected at any given time. Lower the `displayPercentage` during peak traffic periods to control the volume of incoming responses.

## Conclusion

Using the **Show Survey to % of Users** feature allows for precise control over who sees your Formbricks surveys, making it an invaluable feature for targeted data collection and user experience management. By adjusting survey visibility settings, you can strategically engage segments of your audience, enhance survey testing phases, and optimize overall survey effectiveness.
