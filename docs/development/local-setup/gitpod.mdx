<Note>This guide explains how to set up Formbricks in a **Gitpod** cloud workspace. Gitpod provides a fully configured development environment in the browser, with Docker support for running all required services.</Note>

## Requirements

| Tool | Version | Notes |
|------|---------|-------|
| Node.js | ≥20.0.0 | LTS recommended (source: `package.json` engines) |
| pnpm | 10.28.2 | Managed via `packageManager` field (source: `package.json`) |
| Turborepo | 2.5.3 | Build orchestration devDependency (source: `package.json`) |
| Docker | Latest | Required for dev database, cache, storage, and mail services |

You also need a Gitpod workspace with Node.js, pnpm, and Docker support enabled.

## Gitpod Configuration

The repository does not include a `.gitpod.yml` file at the root. Instead, Gitpod initialization is handled by scripts in the `.gitpod/` directory:

- **`.gitpod/init.bash`** — Main initialization script that reads Docker images from `docker-compose.dev.yml` using `yq`, pulls all images in parallel, and runs `pnpm install` in the background. This script is designed for Gitpod prebuilds to speed up workspace startup.
- **`.gitpod/setup-demo.bash`** — Sets up the demo app by running Turborepo tasks for the `@formbricks/demo` package based on `turbo.json` pipeline dependencies.
- **`.gitpod/setup-web.bash`** — Sets up the web app by running Turborepo tasks for the `@formbricks/web` package based on `turbo.json` pipeline dependencies.

These scripts automate Docker image pulling and dependency installation so that Gitpod prebuilds complete faster and workspaces start with all services ready.

Source: `.gitpod/init.bash`, `.gitpod/setup-demo.bash`, `.gitpod/setup-web.bash`

## Docker Development Services

The following Docker services are defined in `docker-compose.dev.yml` and started automatically by `pnpm go` (which runs `pnpm db:up` → `docker compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d`):

| Service | Image | Port(s) | Purpose |
|---------|-------|---------|---------|
| PostgreSQL | `pgvector/pgvector:pg17` | 5432 | Database with pgvector extension on PostgreSQL 17 |
| Valkey | `valkey/valkey` | 6379 | Redis-compatible cache (replaces Redis) |
| MinIO | `minio/minio:RELEASE.2025-09-07T16-13-09Z` | 9000 (S3 API), 9001 (Console) | S3-compatible object storage |
| MailHog | `arjenz/mailhog` | 1025 (SMTP), 8025 (Web UI) | Local email testing |

Source: `docker-compose.dev.yml`

## Setup Steps

<Steps>
  <Step title="Open Repository In Gitpod">
    Open the Formbricks repository in Gitpod. The workspace typically clones the repo automatically. The `.gitpod/init.bash` script handles Docker image pulling and dependency installation during prebuild.

    If manual setup is needed:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/formbricks/formbricks && cd formbricks
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Setup Node.js With nvm">
    Install and activate the required Node.js version using nvm. The `.nvmrc` file in the repository root specifies Node.js 22.1.0:

    ```bash
    nvm install && nvm use
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install Dependencies">
    Install all monorepo dependencies with pnpm:

    ```bash
    pnpm install
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create Environment File">
    Copy the example environment file to create your local configuration:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate Secret Values">
    Generate cryptographically secure values for the required secret environment variables:

    ```bash
    sed -i '/^ENCRYPTION_KEY=/c\ENCRYPTION_KEY='$(openssl rand -hex 32) .env
    sed -i '/^NEXTAUTH_SECRET=/c\NEXTAUTH_SECRET='$(openssl rand -hex 32) .env
    sed -i '/^CRON_SECRET=/c\CRON_SECRET='$(openssl rand -hex 32) .env
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run Database Migrations">
    Apply the Prisma database migrations to set up the PostgreSQL schema:

    ```bash
    pnpm db:migrate:dev
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Generate AGENTS.md File">
    This step is optional and useful for AI-assisted development. It generates an `AGENTS.md` file at the repository root that provides Next.js documentation context for AI coding assistants (e.g., Cursor, GitHub Copilot). It runs `npx @next/codemod agents-md` under the hood. Re-run it whenever you upgrade Next.js.

    ```bash
    pnpm agents:update
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Start Development Setup">
    Start Docker services and all development servers concurrently:

    ```bash
    pnpm go
    ```

    This command starts the Docker development services (PostgreSQL, Valkey, MinIO, MailHog) and launches the Next.js dev server along with other workspace tasks.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## After Setup

<Note>
  On first launch, you will need to create a new account through the Formbricks onboarding flow. Access the running app via the Gitpod forwarded port — typically [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) inside the workspace.
</Note>

<Warning>
  Ensure Docker is enabled in your Gitpod workspace settings. Without Docker support, the development database, cache, storage, and mail services will not start. Check **Gitpod Settings → Feature Flags → Docker** to confirm it is active.
</Warning>
