The Airtable integration allows you to automatically send responses to an Airtable of your choice.

<Note>
  If you are on a self-hosted instance, you will need to configure this integration separately. Please follow
  the guides [here](/self-hosting/configuration/integrations) to configure integrations on your self-hosted
  instance.
</Note>

## Formbricks Cloud

1. Click on the `Configuration` tab in the left sidebar and then click on the `Integrations` tab and click on the `connect` button under the `Airtable` card.

1. Now click on the "Connect with Airtable" button to authenticate yourself with Airtable.

![Connect Formbricks with Airtable](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/airtable/connect-with-airtable.webp)

1. You will now be taken to a page where you need to add and grant access to the base you want to use for the integration.

![Add and grant access to airtable base](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/airtable/add-base.webp)

1. Once you add and grant access to your base, you will be taken back to Formbricks Cloud and see the connected status as below:

<Note>
  Before the next step, make sure that you have a Formbricks Survey with at least one question and a Airtable
  base with atleast one table in the Airtable account you integrated.
</Note>

1. Now click on the "Link New Table" button to link an Airtable with Formbricks and a modal will open up.

![Link Formbricks with a Airtable](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/airtable/link-survey-with-table.webp)

1. Select the Base and table you want to link with Formbricks and the Survey. On doing so, you will be asked with what questions' responses you want to feed in Airtable. Select the questions and click on the "Save" button.

![Select question to link with Airtable](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/airtable/link-with-questions.webp)

1. On submitting, the modal will close and you will see the linked table in the list of linked tables.

![List of linked tables](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/airtable/list-linked-surveys.webp)

Congratulations! You have successfully linked an Airtable with Formbricks. Now whenever a response is submitted for the linked survey, it will be automatically added to the linked Airtable.

## Remove Integration with Airtable

To remove the integration with Airtable,

1. Visit the Integrations tab in your Formbricks Cloud dashboard.

2. Select "Manage" button in the Airtable card.

3. Click on the "Connected with `<your-email-here`>" just before the "Link new Table" button.

4. It will now ask for a confirmation to remove the integration. Click on the "Delete" button to remove the integration. You can always come back and connect again with the same Airtable Account.

## Field Character Limit

Each Airtable field value is limited to **99,995 characters** per field. When a survey response value exceeds this limit, Formbricks automatically truncates the text to fit within the allowed size using its internal `truncateText()` utility.

This limit is intentionally set slightly below Airtable's native 100,000 character maximum for long text fields to provide a safety buffer and avoid write failures.

<Note>
  If you collect open-ended responses that may be very long (e.g., free-text questions), be aware that values exceeding 99,995 characters will be silently truncated before being written to Airtable.
</Note>

Source: `apps/web/lib/constants.ts` (`AIRTABLE_MESSAGE_LIMIT = 99995`), `apps/web/lib/airtable/service.ts`

## PKCE S256 Authorization

Airtable requires **PKCE (Proof Key for Code Exchange)** with the **S256 challenge method** for OAuth authorization. This is a more secure OAuth variant that prevents authorization code interception attacks.

The PKCE S256 flow works as follows:

1. Formbricks generates a random `code_verifier` string.
2. A `code_challenge` is computed as the **SHA-256 hash** of the `code_verifier`, encoded in **base64url** format.
3. The authorization request sent to Airtable includes the `code_challenge` along with `code_challenge_method=S256`.
4. During the token exchange step, Formbricks sends the original `code_verifier` to Airtable to prove its identity.

<Note>
  PKCE is handled entirely by Formbricks behind the scenes. You do not need to manually configure or manage PKCE parameters — simply click "Connect with Airtable" and Formbricks takes care of the secure authorization flow.
</Note>

## Base And Table Selection

During the integration setup, Formbricks discovers your Airtable bases and tables automatically using the Airtable Meta API:

- **Base Discovery:** Formbricks calls the Airtable Meta API endpoint (`/v0/meta/bases`) to retrieve a list of all bases your OAuth grant has access to.
- **Table Discovery:** After you select a base, Formbricks fetches the available tables for that base via `/v0/meta/bases/{baseId}/tables`.
- **Field Metadata:** Table metadata returned by the API includes field definitions (names and types), which Formbricks uses to present field mapping options during setup.

The user workflow is:

1. Select an Airtable **base** from the list of accessible bases.
2. Select a **table** within that base.
3. Map survey questions to the appropriate Airtable **fields** (columns).

All API calls are authenticated using the OAuth access token obtained during the connection step.

Source: `apps/web/lib/airtable/service.ts`

## Field Type Mapping

Survey response values are mapped to Airtable fields based on the configuration you choose during setup:

- When linking a survey to an Airtable table, each selected survey question appears as a column option that can be mapped to an existing Airtable field.
- Response data is written as **text values** regardless of the Airtable field type. Airtable will attempt to parse the value according to the destination field type (e.g., a number string written to a Number field).
- Values exceeding the **99,995 character** field limit are automatically truncated before writing.

<Note>
  For best results, use Airtable **Long Text** or **Single Line Text** field types for survey response mappings. Other field types (Number, Date, etc.) require response values that match the expected format.
</Note>

## Token Refresh Flow

Airtable OAuth access tokens expire periodically and require automatic refresh. Formbricks handles this process transparently:

1. When a token refresh is needed, Formbricks sends a **POST** request to `https://airtable.com/oauth2/v1/token`.
2. The request uses `Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded` (form-encoded body, not JSON).
3. The request body includes the following parameters:
   - `grant_type` — Set to `refresh_token` for token renewal
   - `refresh_token` — The previously stored refresh token
   - `client_id` — The value of the `AIRTABLE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable
4. For the initial token exchange (after first authorization), the `code_verifier` from the PKCE flow is also included.
5. On successful refresh, the new access and refresh tokens are securely stored via `createOrUpdateIntegration()`.

<Note>
  Token refresh is fully automatic. If a refresh fails (e.g., due to revoked access), you will need to remove the integration and reconnect with Airtable.

## Self-Hosted Configuration

To enable the Airtable integration on a self-hosted Formbricks instance, the following environment variable must be configured:

| Environment Variable | Description |
|---------------------|-------------|
| `AIRTABLE_CLIENT_ID` | Your Airtable OAuth application Client ID. Required for the OAuth authorization flow and token refresh. |

<Note>
  For complete self-hosted Airtable integration setup instructions — including creating an Airtable OAuth app, configuring redirect URLs, and setting required scopes — see the [self-hosted Airtable configuration guide](/self-hosting/configuration/integrations/airtable).
</Note>

Source: `apps/web/lib/constants.ts`, `apps/web/lib/airtable/service.ts`

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| No bases appearing in the dropdown | OAuth grant does not include base access | Re-authenticate with Airtable and ensure you grant access to the needed bases during the OAuth consent screen |
| Data truncated in Airtable fields | Response value exceeds the 99,995 character limit | This is expected behavior — long text field values are automatically capped at the limit |
| "Invalid token" errors | OAuth access token expired and automatic refresh failed | Remove the Airtable integration from the Integrations tab and reconnect |
| Base permissions changed or base not found | The Airtable base was unshared, deleted, or moved | Re-authenticate to grant Formbricks access to the base again |
| Integration not available on self-hosted | `AIRTABLE_CLIENT_ID` environment variable is not set | Configure the environment variable as described in [Self-Hosted Configuration](#self-hosted-configuration) above |
