Remove the 'Powered by Formbricks' signature in both Link Surveys and In-product surveys as well as on emails sent out via Formbricks.

## What Gets Removed

- **Link Surveys** — The "Powered by Formbricks" badge is removed from the bottom of link surveys.
- **In-Product Surveys** — The branding footer is removed from website and app surveys displayed via the JavaScript SDK.
- **Emails** — The Formbricks branding is removed from transactional emails sent to respondents.

  This feature can be combined with [White-label Email Follow-ups](/self-hosting/advanced/enterprise-features/whitelabel-email-follow-ups) for a fully branded experience across all respondent touchpoints.

## Enabling Branding Removal

To hide the Formbricks branding across your surveys and emails:

1. Navigate to your **Project Settings → General**.
2. Toggle the **Remove Formbricks Branding** option.
3. The setting applies to all surveys within the project — both new and existing surveys will no longer display the branding.
