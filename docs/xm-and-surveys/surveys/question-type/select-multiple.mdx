## Elements

![Overview of Multi Select question type](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/question-type/multi-select.webp)

### Title

Add a clear title to inform the respondent what information you are asking for. This maps to the `headline` field in the survey schema and supports multi-language translations via the I18n string format.

### Description

Provide an optional description with further instructions. This maps to the `subheader` field in the survey schema and is optional. It also supports multi-language translations.

### Options

Define the choices shown in the list. Each choice is an object with:

- **`id`** (string) — A unique identifier for the choice
- **`label`** (I18n string) — The display text shown to the respondent, with support for multi-language translations

A minimum of **2 choices** is required for every multi-select question. Each choice supports localized labels for multi-language surveys.

### "Other" Option

You can add an **"Other"** option to allow respondents to enter a custom answer that is not covered by the predefined choices. When enabled:

- An additional text input appears beneath the predefined choices
- Respondents can type a free-text response in the input field
- The "Other" choice uses a special `id` value of `"other"` in the schema
- You can customize the placeholder text displayed in the free-text input via the `otherOptionPlaceholder` field

<Note>
  The "Other" option is useful when you want to capture answers you may not have anticipated. Combine it with the **Randomize all except last** shuffle option to keep the "Other" choice anchored at the bottom of the list.
</Note>

### Display Type

The `displayType` field controls how the multi-select choices are rendered to the respondent. Two display modes are available:

| Display Type | Description |
|---|---|
| `list` | Standard checkbox list layout where all choices are visible at once. This is the **default** display type. |
| `dropdown` | Dropdown multi-select layout where choices appear in a collapsible dropdown menu. Useful when you have a large number of choices. |

<Note>
  If no `displayType` is specified, the question defaults to the `list` (checkbox) layout.
</Note>

### Choice Randomization

Use the shuffle option to control the order in which choices are presented to respondents. Randomizing choice order helps reduce ordering bias in survey results.

| Shuffle Option | Description |
|---|---|
| **Keep current order** (`none`) | Choices appear in the order they were added in the editor. |
| **Randomize all** (`all`) | All choices are randomized for each respondent. |
| **Randomize all except last** (`exceptLast`) | All choices are randomized except the last one. This is useful when you want to keep the "Other" option anchored at the bottom. |

### Validation Rules

Multi-select questions support validation rules that constrain how many choices a respondent must or can select. The following rules are available:

| Rule | Parameter | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `minSelections` | `{ min: number }` (min ≥ 1) | The minimum number of choices that must be selected. The survey will not allow the respondent to proceed until at least this many choices are checked. |
| `maxSelections` | `{ max: number }` (max ≥ 1) | The maximum number of choices that can be selected. The survey prevents the respondent from checking more than this many choices. |

You can combine both rules to define a valid selection range. For example, setting `minSelections` to `2` and `maxSelections` to `5` requires the respondent to select between 2 and 5 options.

<Note>
  When multiple validation rules are applied, they are combined using the `and` logic operator by default, meaning **all** rules must be satisfied for the response to be valid.
</Note>

## Additional Actions

- **Convert to Single Select**: Converts the question to a [single select](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/question-type/select-single) question. This replaces checkboxes with radio buttons and limits the respondent to a single selection.

Other than the ability for respondents to select multiple options and the availability of min/max selection validation rules, multi-select questions share the same configuration model as [single select](/xm-and-surveys/surveys/question-type/select-single) questions.
