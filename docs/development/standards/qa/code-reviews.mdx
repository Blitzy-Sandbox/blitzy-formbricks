## Initial Checks Via GitHub Workflows

When a Pull Request (PR) is opened, several automated GitHub workflows perform critical checks to ensure code quality before any manual review begins.

<Note>
  At Formbricks, all feature changes must be submitted through Pull Requests — direct pushes to protected branches are not allowed.
</Note>

The main `pr.yml` workflow (named **PR Update**) orchestrates the following reusable sub-workflows:

1. **Unit Tests** (`test.yml`): Runs Vitest unit test suites across the monorepo to catch regressions early.
2. **Linting** (`lint.yml`): Enforces shared ESLint rules (`@formbricks/eslint-config`) and Prettier formatting (110-char width, semicolons, double quotes).
3. **Build Verification** (`build-web.yml`): Confirms that `pnpm build` completes successfully for `apps/web`.
4. **E2E Tests** (`e2e.yml`): Launches the Playwright browser regression suite against a full environment with PostgreSQL + pgvector and Valkey.

In addition, the following workflows run independently on every pull request:

5. **PR Title Validation** (`semantic-pull-requests.yml`): Uses `amannn/action-semantic-pull-request` to enforce [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format (`fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`, etc.).
6. **Translation Validation** (`translation-check.yml`): Validates that translation keys are consistent across the 14-locale i18n system when relevant source or locale files are changed.
7. **SonarQube** (`sonarqube.yml`): Code quality analysis, code smell detection, and security hotspot identification. Runs on PRs and pushes to `main`.

<Note>
  All automated checks must pass before proceeding to manual review. The PR Update summary job aggregates results from the four orchestrated sub-workflows and fails the PR if any of them fail or are skipped.
</Note>

## Pull Request Template

Every PR must follow the template defined in `.github/pull_request_template.md`. Proper use of the template speeds up reviews and ensures consistent quality across contributions.

### PR Title

PR titles must follow the [Conventional Commits specification](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/). Accepted prefixes include `fix:`, `feat:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `perf:`, `test:`, `build:`, `ci:`, and `revert:`. The PR number is typically appended on merge:

```text
fix: update OpenAPI schema (#6617)
feat: add survey validation
chore: bump dependencies
```

### Description

Summarize the change, link the related issue (`Fixes #issue`), and provide motivation and context. Include screenshots or a [Loom](https://www.loom.com/) recording for any visual changes.

### How To Test

Provide clear, step-by-step instructions so reviewers can reproduce and verify the changes.

### Required Checklist

- [ ] Filled out the "How to test" section
- [ ] Read [How we Code at Formbricks](https://formbricks.com/docs/contributing/how-we-code)
- [ ] Self-reviewed own code
- [ ] Commented on hard-to-understand bits
- [ ] Ran `pnpm build`
- [ ] Checked for warnings (none)
- [ ] Removed all `console.logs`
- [ ] Merged latest changes from main with `git pull origin main`
- [ ] No responsiveness issues
- [ ] First PR? Signed the [CLA](https://cla-assistant.io/formbricks/formbricks)

### Appreciated Checklist

- [ ] If a UI change was made: Added a screen recording or screenshots to the PR
- [ ] Updated the Formbricks Docs if changes were necessary

<Note>
  The Contributor License Agreement (CLA) signature is required for first-time contributors. Without a signed CLA, the PR cannot be merged.

## Reviewer Assignment

Once all automated checks pass successfully:

- A team member with relevant expertise is assigned as the reviewer
- The reviewer is notified automatically through GitHub
- Priority is given based on PR urgency and complexity

## Functional Testing And UI Review

The assigned reviewer performs thorough testing:

### Functionality Testing

- Verifies that new features work as specified
- Tests edge cases and error scenarios
- Ensures proper error handling
- Checks integration with existing features

### UI Review (If Applicable)

- Validates visual consistency
- Checks responsive behavior
- Ensures accessibility standards
- Reviews user interaction flows

## Feedback Process

If improvements are needed:

- Reviewers add inline comments on GitHub
- Feedback is specific and actionable
- Code suggestions are provided when helpful
- Comments follow constructive feedback guidelines

## In-Depth Code Review

The code review process utilizes both human expertise and AI assistance:

### Manual Review

Reviewers evaluate the following areas, informed by the project quality checklist:

- **Code Quality:** Keep code DRY and small; remove dead code and unused imports. Functions should be focused and single-purpose.
- **Type Safety:** Avoid `any`; use shared types from `@formbricks/types` and prefer type inference over explicit annotations.
- **Test Coverage:** Run `pnpm test` before opening a PR. Use `pnpm test:coverage` when touching critical flows and keep coverage from regressing.
- **Documentation Completeness:** Verify that documentation is updated if changes warrant it. Add JSDoc comments on exported functions.
- **React Best Practices:** Follow React hooks rules, keep effects focused, and avoid unnecessary `useMemo`/`useCallback`. Keep components focused and avoid deep nesting.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure basic accessibility standards are met (semantic HTML, ARIA attributes, keyboard navigation).
- **Security Implications:** Check for exposed secrets, injection vectors, and proper authentication and authorization checks.
- **Performance Considerations:** Write efficient database queries, avoid N+1 patterns, and use proper caching strategies.

<Note>
  Avoid `any` — use shared types from `@formbricks/types` and prefer type inference. This is a critical rule enforced during all code reviews.

### AI-Assisted Review

Advanced AI tools provide additional automated insights on every pull request:

- **Code Rabbit:** Automated code analysis and inline suggestions on PRs, highlighting potential issues and recommending improvements.
- **SonarQube:** Code quality metrics, code smell detection, and security hotspot analysis. SonarQube runs automatically on all PRs and pushes to `main` via the `sonarqube.yml` workflow.

## Resolution And Merge

Final steps before merging:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Address Review Comments">
    All review comments must be addressed and all conversations resolved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Implement Required Changes">
    Any requested changes are implemented and pushed to the PR branch.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Obtain Approval">
    At least one reviewer approval is required before merging.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Pass CI/CD Pipeline">
    All CI/CD checks must pass, including unit tests, linting, build verification, E2E tests, translation validation, and SonarQube analysis.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Merge">
    The PR is merged into the target branch.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

- Keep PRs focused and reasonably sized for efficient review cycles
- Respond to review comments promptly
- Attach screenshots or GIFs for UI-facing work
- List any database migrations or environment variable changes in the PR description
- Paste output of relevant commands (`pnpm test`, `pnpm lint`, `pnpm db:migrate:dev`) so reviewers can verify readiness
- Use the "Request Changes" feature when blocking issues are found
- Mark conversations as resolved when addressed
