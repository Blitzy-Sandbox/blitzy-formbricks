Organization-level roles apply to all teams and projects within your Formbricks organization. These roles provide broad permissions that determine what users can do across the entire organization.

<Note>
  Access Roles is a feature of the [Enterprise Edition](/self-hosting/advanced/license). In the **Community Edition** and on the **Free**
  and **Startup** plan in the Cloud you can invite unlimited organization members as `Owner`.
</Note>

## Role Hierarchy

Here are the different access permissions, ranked from highest to lowest access:

1. **Owner** - Full organizational control
2. **Manager** - Management access with some restrictions
3. **Member** - Basic access to assigned projects
4. **Billing** - Billing and payment management only

### Role Permissions and Privilege Escalation Prevention

To prevent privilege escalation, the following rules apply:

- **Owners** can:
  - Invite users as owners, managers, or members
  - Assign roles up to owner level

- **Managers** can:
  - Invite users only as members
  - Assign roles up to member only, not manager, billing, or owner

- **Members** cannot:
  - Invite users
  - Assign roles

## Organization-Level Roles

All users and their organization-level roles are listed in **Organization Settings > Access Control**. Users can hold any of the following org-level roles:

### Owner
- Have full access to the organization, its data, and settings
- Can perform Team Admin actions without needing to join the team
- Can manage all aspects of the organization including billing, integrations, and member management
- Can transfer ownership to another organization member
- Can configure organization-wide settings such as billing, subscription, and security
- While multiple users can hold the Owner role, only one is designated as the primary organization owner who can initiate ownership transfer

### Manager
- Have full management access to all teams and projects
- Can manage the organization's membership (but can only invite or assign users as members)
- Can perform Team Admin actions without needing to join the team
- Can create and delete projects
- Can manage integrations across projects
- Cannot change other organization settings like billing or delete the organization
- Cannot transfer ownership or escalate roles beyond member

### Member
- Can view most data in the organization and act in the projects they are members of
- Cannot create or join projects on their own and need to be assigned by owners or managers
- Have limited permissions that depend on their project-level access
- Can create and manage surveys within assigned projects
- Cannot manage organization settings, billing, or other members

### Billing
- Can manage payment and compliance details in the organization
- Have access to billing settings and subscription management
- Can manage subscription plans and payment methods
- Cannot access projects, surveys, or other organizational data or settings

## Changing Member Roles

Only **Owners** and **Managers** can change the roles of other organization members. To update a member's role:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Navigate To Access Control">
    Go to **Organization Settings > Access Control** to view the list of all organization members and their current roles.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Select The Member">
    Find the member whose role you want to change in the member list.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Open The Role Dropdown">
    Click on the member's current role to open the role selection dropdown.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Assign The New Role">
    Select the new role from the dropdown. The change takes effect immediately.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
  **Privilege escalation prevention:** Owners can assign any role (Owner, Manager, Member, or Billing). Managers can only assign the **Member** role — they cannot promote users to Manager, Billing, or Owner.
</Note>

## Ownership Transfer

The ownership transfer process allows the current primary Owner to designate another organization member as the new Owner.

- Only an existing **Owner** can initiate an ownership transfer
- The selected member receives the **Owner** role
- The original owner's role is changed after the transfer completes

<Warning>
  Ownership transfer is a critical and irreversible operation. Once you transfer ownership to another member, your role will be changed. Ensure you are transferring ownership to the correct person before confirming the action.
</Warning>

## Source Reference

The four organization-level roles (`owner`, `manager`, `member`, `billing`) are defined in `packages/types/memberships.ts` as a Zod enum (`ZOrganizationRole`). Role assignment and membership management logic resides in `apps/web/modules/organization/`.

## Best Practices

- **Principle of least privilege**: Assign users the minimum role necessary for their responsibilities
- **Regular audits**: Periodically review organization members and their roles
- **Owner role**: Limit the number of owners to reduce security risk
- **Manager role**: Use for team leads who need to manage projects but not organizational settings
