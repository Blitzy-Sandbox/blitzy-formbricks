![Overview of Address question type](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/question-type/address.webp)

### Title

Provide a clear title (mapped to the `headline` field in the schema) to describe the address information you are requesting.

### Description

Optionally, add a description to give the respondent additional context. The description field supports HTML content, allowing you to include formatted text, links, or emphasis as needed.

### Address Fields

The address question type is a multi-field input composed of six individual sub-fields. Each field uses a toggle configuration (`ZToggleInputConfig`) with the following properties:

- **`show`** (boolean) — Controls whether the field is visible to the respondent
- **`required`** (boolean) — Controls whether the field must be filled in before submission
- **`placeholder`** (i18n string) — Placeholder text displayed inside the empty input

You can independently toggle each field to show or hide it, and mark it as required or optional, giving you full control over which address components to collect.

| Schema Field Name | Display Label | Description |
|-------------------|---------------|-------------|
| `addressLine1` | Address Line 1 | Primary street address |
| `addressLine2` | Address Line 2 | Apartment, suite, unit, or additional details |
| `city` | City | City or locality |
| `state` | State | State, province, or region |
| `zip` | Zip Code | Postal or zip code |
| `country` | Country | Country name |

<Note>
  Each of the six address sub-fields can be configured independently. For example, you might show `addressLine1`, `city`, and `country` as required while hiding `addressLine2`, `state`, and `zip` entirely.
</Note>

### Validation Rules

Address elements support text-based validation rules that can be applied to individual sub-fields. Multiple rules are combined using a logic operator (`and` or `or`).

The following validation rules are available for address fields:

| Rule | Parameters | Description |
|------|------------|-------------|
| `minLength` | `{ min: number }` | Minimum character length for the field value |
| `maxLength` | `{ max: number }` | Maximum character length for the field value |
| `pattern` | `{ pattern: string, flags?: string }` | Regex pattern matching against the field value |
| `email` | _none_ | Validates that the field value is a valid email format |
| `url` | _none_ | Validates that the field value is a valid URL format |
| `phone` | _none_ | Validates that the field value is a valid phone number format |
| `equals` | `{ value: string }` | Requires an exact match with the specified value |
| `doesNotEqual` | `{ value: string }` | Rejects the specified value |
| `contains` | `{ value: string }` | Requires the field value to contain the specified substring |
| `doesNotContain` | `{ value: string }` | Rejects values containing the specified substring |

#### Field-Targeted Validation

Each validation rule includes an optional `field` property that specifies which address sub-field the rule applies to. The available field targets correspond to the six address fields:

`addressLine1` · `addressLine2` · `city` · `state` · `zip` · `country`

This means you can apply different validation rules to different sub-fields. For example, you could enforce a `minLength` of 3 on the `city` field while applying a `pattern` rule to the `zip` field for postal code formatting.

<Note>
  When no `field` is specified on a validation rule, it applies broadly to the element. Use field-targeted rules to enforce fine-grained constraints on individual address components.
</Note>

### International Address Support

The address question type is designed to accommodate international addresses. All six sub-fields accept free-text input with no country-specific format enforced. The **Country** field allows respondents to enter any country name, making this question type suitable for collecting addresses globally.

No built-in country dropdown or postal code format restriction is applied — the fields are flexible text inputs that work for any locale.

### Response Data Format

When a respondent submits an address question, the response data is stored as an object with keys matching the six field names. Each key contains the text value entered by the respondent.

```json
{
  "addressLine1": "123 Main Street",
  "addressLine2": "Suite 400",
  "city": "San Francisco",
  "state": "CA",
  "zip": "94105",
  "country": "United States"
}
```

<Note>
  Only fields with `show` set to `true` will appear in the survey. Fields that are hidden will not be present in the response data.
</Note>
