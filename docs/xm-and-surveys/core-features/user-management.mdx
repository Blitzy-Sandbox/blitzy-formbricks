Formbricks provides comprehensive user management capabilities to help you control access, organize teams, and secure your organization. This section covers everything you need to know about managing users, roles, and permissions.

Formbricks organizes resources in a clear hierarchy:

- **Organization** — The top-level entity that contains all resources, members, and billing settings
- **Projects** — Contain surveys, integrations, and project-specific settings within an organization
- **Environments** — Each project includes development and production environments for safe testing
- **Surveys** — Created and managed within a specific environment

User access is controlled at multiple levels through organization roles, team roles, and project permissions, giving you fine-grained control over who can see and do what.

## Key Concepts

Formbricks uses a flexible permission system with multiple layers:

- **Organization roles** — 4 roles (Owner, Manager, Member, Billing) control access across the entire organization including member management, billing, and project creation
- **Team roles** — 2 roles (Admin, Contributor) provide granular permissions within specific teams for collaborative project access (Enterprise feature)
- **Project permissions** — Fine-tune access to individual projects through team-project assignments with Read, Read & Write, or Manage permission levels
- **Security features** — Protect accounts with TOTP two-factor authentication and single-use backup codes (Enterprise feature)

The following diagram illustrates how these layers map to the resource hierarchy:

| Level | Resource | Access Controlled By |
|-------|----------|---------------------|
| 1 | Organization | Organization roles (Owner, Manager, Member, Billing) |
| 2 | Teams | Team roles (Admin, Contributor) |
| 3 | Projects | Project permissions (Read, Read & Write, Manage) |
| 4 | Environments | Inherited from project permissions |
| 5 | Surveys | Inherited from environment and project permissions |

<Note>
  Advanced user management features including team-based access control, role management, and two-factor authentication are part of the Formbricks [Enterprise Edition](/self-hosting/advanced/license). The Community Edition and Free/Startup Cloud plans support unlimited organization members with Owner permissions.
