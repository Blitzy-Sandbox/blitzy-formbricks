![Formbricks is now connected with Slack](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/slack/slack-connected.webp)

<Note>
  Before the next step, make sure that you have a Formbricks Survey with at
  least one question and a Slack channel in the Slack workspace you integrated.
</Note>

1. In order to make your channel available in channel dropdown, you need to add formbricks integration bot to the channel you want to link. You can do this by going to channel settings -> Integrations -> Add apps -> Search for "Formbricks" -> Select the bot -> Add.

![Click on three dot at top right of the channel](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/slack/add-slack-bot-1.webp)

![Select Edit Settings](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/slack/add-slack-bot-2.webp)

![Navigate to Integrations](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/slack/add-slack-bot-3.webp)

![Add Formbricks Bot](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/slack/add-slack-bot-4.webp)

1. Now click on the "Link channel" button to link a Slack channel with Formbricks and a modal will open up.

![Link Formbricks with a Slack Channel](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/slack/link-survey-with-channel.webp)

1. Select the channel you want to link with Formbricks and the Survey. On doing so, you will be asked to select the questions' responses you want to feed in the Slack channel. Select the questions and click on the "Link Channel" button.

![Select question to link with Slack Channel](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/slack/link-with-questions.webp)

1. On submitting, the modal will close and you will see the linked Slack channel in the list of linked Slack channels.

Congratulations! You have successfully linked a Slack channel with Formbricks. Now whenever a response is submitted for the linked survey, it will be automatically sent to the linked Slack channel.

## Slack OAuth Scopes

Formbricks requires the following **Bot Token Scopes** to interact with your Slack workspace:

| Scope | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `channels:read` | Read public channel information so they appear in the channel dropdown |
| `groups:read` | Read private channel information so they appear in the channel dropdown |
| `chat:write` | Post survey response messages to channels the bot has been added to |
| `chat:write.public` | Post messages to public channels the bot is not a member of |
| `chat:write.customize` | Customize the bot message appearance (name and icon) |

Internally, Formbricks uses the Slack `users.conversations` API with `types=private_channel,public_channel` to fetch available channels. Channels are retrieved using cursor-based pagination with a limit of 200 channels per page.

<Note>
  The Formbricks bot uses `users.conversations` to list both private and public channels. For a channel to appear in the channel dropdown, the Formbricks bot must be added to that channel first. You can add it via **Channel Settings → Integrations → Add Apps** and searching for your Formbricks app.

## Setup In Self-Hosted Formbricks

Enabling the Slack Integration in a self-hosted environment requires a setup using slack workspace account and changing the environment variables of your Formbricks instance.

<Note>
  If you are running Formbricks locally:

  You need to use `https` instead of `http` for the redirect URI.

  * You can update the `go` script in your `apps/web/package.json` to include the `--experimental-https` flag. The
    command will look like: <br />

    ```bash
      "go": next dev --experimental-https -p 3000
    ```

  * You also need to update the .env file in the `apps/web` directory to include the `WEBAPP_URL` as `https://localhost:3000` instead of `http://localhost:3000`.

  * You also need to run the terminal in admin mode to run the `go` script(to acquire the SSL certificate). You can do this by running the terminal as an administrator or using the `sudo` command in Unix-based systems.
</Note>

1. Create a Slack workspace if you don't have one already.

2. Go to the [Your apps](https://api.slack.com/apps) page and **Create New App**.

3. Click on **From Scratch** and provide the **App Name** and select your workspace in **Pick a workspace to develop your app in:** dropdown. Click on **Create App**.

4. Go to the **OAuth & Permissions** tab on the sidebar and add the following **Bot Token Scopes**:

   * `channels:read`

   * `groups:read`

   * `chat:write`

   * `chat:write.public`

   * `chat:write.customize`

5. Add the **Redirect URLs** under **OAuth & Permissions** tab. You can add the following URLs:

   * If you are running formbricks locally, you can enter `https://localhost:3000/api/v1/integrations/slack/callback`.

   * Or, you can enter `https://<your-public-facing-url>/api/v1/integrations/slack/callback`

6. Now, click on **Install to Workspace** and **Allow** the permissions.

7. Go to the **Basic Information** tab on the sidebar and copy the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**. Copy them and set them as the environment variables in your Formbricks instance as:

* `SLACK_CLIENT_ID` - OAuth Client ID

* `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET` - OAuth Client Secret

1. Now, you need to enable the public distribution of your app. Go to the **Basic Information** tab and click on the **Manage distribution** button and click on the "Distribute App".

2. Scroll down to the **Share your app with other workspaces** section, complete the checklist and click on the **Activate public distribution** button.

### By now, your environment variables should include the below ones:

* `SLACK_CLIENT_ID`

* `SLACK_CLIENT_SECRET`

Voila! You have successfully enabled the Slack integration in your self-hosted Formbricks instance. Now you can follow the steps mentioned in the [Formbricks Cloud](#formbricks-cloud) section to link a Slack workspace with Formbricks.

## Remove Integration with Slack Workspace

To remove the integration with Slack Workspace,

1. Visit the Integrations tab in your Formbricks Cloud dashboard.

2. Select "Manage" button in the Slack card.

3. Click on the "Delete Integration" button.

4. It will now ask for a confirmation to remove the integration. Click on the "Delete" button to remove the integration. You can always come back and connect again with the same Slack Workspace.

## Message Limits And Formatting

Slack imposes character limits on messages. Formbricks enforces a **2,995 character limit** per response field value (`SLACK_MESSAGE_LIMIT = 2995` in `apps/web/lib/constants.ts`). When an individual response text exceeds this limit, it is automatically truncated using the `truncateText()` utility, which appends `...` to the shortened text.

Survey responses are posted to Slack using the [Block Kit](https://api.slack.com/block-kit) format. Each message is structured as follows:

- A **header section** displaying the survey name
- A **divider** separating the header from the responses
- A **question-response pair** for each selected survey question, where the question label is formatted as bold text (`*Question Label*`) and the response value is displayed below it

Below is an approximate example of the Slack message structure:

```text
My Customer Feedback Survey
────────────────────────────
*How satisfied are you with our product?*
Very satisfied

*What could we improve?*
The onboarding experience could be smoother...

*Any additional comments?*
I really enjoy using the product overall. The interface is clean and intuitive.
```

<Note>
  Each question-response pair is individually checked against the 2,995 character limit. If a single response exceeds this limit, only that response is truncated — other responses in the same message are unaffected.
</Note>

## Token Expiry Handling

Formbricks automatically handles expired Slack tokens. When the Slack API returns a `token_expired` error during channel fetching, the integration is automatically **deleted** via `deleteIntegration()`. This is a security measure designed to handle Slack's token rotation feature.

After an automatic disconnection, users must re-authenticate and reconnect the Slack integration from the Integrations tab.

<Warning>
  If Slack's token rotation is enabled for your workspace, your Formbricks-Slack integration may be automatically disconnected when the token expires. You will need to reconnect the integration by clicking "Connect with Slack" again on the Integrations page.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

Below are common issues you may encounter with the Slack integration and their solutions:

| Issue | Cause | Solution |
|-------|-------|----------|
| Channel not appearing in dropdown | Bot not added to channel | Add the Formbricks bot to the channel via **Channel Settings → Integrations → Add Apps** |
| Integration suddenly disconnected | Token rotation enabled in Slack | Re-authenticate and reconnect the integration from the Integrations tab |
| Messages truncated | Response exceeds 2,995 characters | This is expected behavior; long responses are automatically truncated with `...` |
| `token_expired` error | Slack token rotation | Re-connect the integration from the Integrations tab |
| Missing permissions | Incorrect bot scopes | Verify all 5 required scopes (`channels:read`, `groups:read`, `chat:write`, `chat:write.public`, `chat:write.customize`) are configured in your Slack app settings |
| Bot cannot post to channel | Bot not a member of private channel | Invite the Formbricks bot to the private channel, or use `chat:write.public` scope for public channels |

<Note>
  For self-hosted instances, ensure your Slack app's OAuth redirect URL matches your Formbricks instance URL. See the [self-hosted Slack configuration guide](/self-hosting/configuration/integrations/slack) for detailed setup instructions.
