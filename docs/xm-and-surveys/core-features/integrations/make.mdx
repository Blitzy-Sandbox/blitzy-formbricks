Make is a powerful tool to send information between Formbricks and thousands of apps. Here's how to set it up.

<Note>
  Nailed down your survey?? Any changes in the survey cause additional work in the *Scenario*. It makes sense to first settle on the survey you want to run and then get to setting up Make.
</Note>

## Step 1: Setup Your Survey Incl. `questionId` For Every Question

Set up the `questionId`s of your survey questions before publishing.

![Update Question ID](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/make/update-question-id.webp)

*Update the Question ID field in every question card under Advanced Settings.*

<Note>
  Already published? Duplicate survey You can only update the questionId
  before publishing the survey. If already published, simply duplicate it.

</Note>

## Step 2: Setup Make.com

Visit [Make.com](https://make.com) to start a new scenario.

![Create New Scenario](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/make/create-new-scenario.webp)

Search for `Formbricks`:

![Search Formbricks](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/make/search-formbricks.webp)

Choose the event to trigger the Scenario:

![Select Triggers](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/make/select-trigger.webp)

## Step 3: Connect Formbricks With Make

Click "Create a webhook":

![Create Webhook](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/make/create-webhook.webp)

Enter the Formbricks API Host and API Key. API Host is by default set to [https://app.formbricks.com](https://app.formbricks.com) but can be modified for self-hosting instances. Learn how to get an API Key from the [API Key tutorial](/api-reference/generate-key).

## Step 4: Select Survey

Choose from your created surveys:

## Step 5: Send A Test Response

You need a test response for Make setup.

![Submit Test Response](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/make/submit-test-response.webp)

## Step 6: Set Up Google Sheet

Decide on the desired action for the data. Here, we'll send submissions to a Google Sheet:

![Add Module](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/make/add-module.webp)

Choose "Add a Row" for the action:

![Select Action](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/make/select-action.webp)

Specify the spreadsheet details and match the Formbricks data:

![Select Fields](/images/xm-and-surveys/core-features/integrations/make/select-fields.webp)

A new row gets added to the spreadsheet for every response:

## Data Mapping

When a survey response triggers your Make scenario, the Formbricks module delivers the full webhook payload. Response data is keyed by each question's `questionId`, making it straightforward to map individual answers to fields in downstream modules.

The payload contains the following top-level field groups:

| Field Group | Description |
|------------|-------------|
| `data.*` | Survey response values keyed by `questionId` (e.g., `data.satisfaction`, `data.feedback`) |
| `meta.*` | Response metadata such as browser, operating system, and URL where the survey was displayed |
| `survey.*` | Survey configuration details including the survey name, status, and question definitions |

Use these fields in subsequent Make modules to route and transform data for connected services such as Google Sheets, Slack, CRMs, or any of the 1000+ platforms available on Make.
