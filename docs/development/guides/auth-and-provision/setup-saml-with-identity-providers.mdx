## SAML Registration With Identity Providers

This guide explains the settings you need to use to configure SAML with your Identity Provider. Once configured, obtain an XML metadata file and use it to configure SAML in Formbricks.

<Note>
  Please do not add a trailing slash at the end of the URLs. Create them exactly as shown below.
</Note>

**Assertion consumer service URL / Single Sign-On URL / Destination URL:** [https://app.formbricks.com/api/auth/saml/callback](https://app.formbricks.com/api/auth/saml/callback)

**Entity ID / Identifier / Audience URI / Audience Restriction:** [https://saml.formbricks.com](https://saml.formbricks.com)

<Note>
  [https://saml.formbricks.com](https://saml.formbricks.com) is hardcoded in Formbricks — do not replace it with your instance URL. It is the fixed SP Entity ID and must match exactly as shown in SAML assertions.
</Note>

**Response:** Signed

**Assertion Signature:** Signed

**Signature Algorithm:** RSA-SHA256

**Assertion Encryption:** Unencrypted

**NameID Format:** EmailAddress

**Application username:** email

**Mapping Attributes / Attribute Statements:**

- Name claim:

  If your IdP has a `name` claim, set the following claims to populate the name field:

  | Name | Name Format | Value     |
  | ---- | ----------- | --------- |
  | name | Basic       | user.name |

  Many IdPs do not have a `name` claim. If not, you can use different claims to populate the name field. The order of precedence is `name` -> **other options** -> `email`.

  **Other options:**

  | Name      | Name Format | Value                     |
  | --------- | ----------- | ------------------------- |
  | firstName | Basic       | **FIRST_NAME_EQUIVALENT** |
  | lastName  | Basic       | **LAST_NAME_EQUIVALENT**  |

  Refer to the table below for the different claims you can use for each IdP.

  | IdP                           | FIRST_NAME_EQUIVALENT            | LAST_NAME_EQUIVALENT             |
  | ----------------------------- | -------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
  | Okta                          | user.firstName                   | user.lastName                    |
  | Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD) | user.givenName                   | user.surname                     |
  | Google Workspace              | user.given_name / user.firstName | user.family_name / user.lastName |
  | OneLogin                      | user.FirstName / user.first_name | user.LastName / user.last_name   |
  | Auth0                         | user.given_name                  | user.family_name                 |
  | JumpCloud                     | user.firstname                   | user.lastname                    |

  Above provided claims may differ based on your configuration and the IdP you are using. Please refer to the documentation of your IdP for the correct claims.

    - **Audience URI (SP Entity ID)**: `https://saml.formbricks.com` (hardcoded; do not replace with your instance URL)
    <img src="/images/development/guides/auth-and-provision/okta/saml-integration-settings.webp" alt="Okta SAML Settings page with Single Sign-On URL and Audience URI configured" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Fill the fields mapping as shown and click Next">
    <img src="/images/development/guides/auth-and-provision/okta/fields-mapping.webp" alt="Okta Attribute Statements configuration with name mapping fields" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Check the internal app checkbox and click Finish">
    <img src="/images/development/guides/auth-and-provision/okta/internal-app.webp" alt="Okta Feedback page with the internal app checkbox selected" />

  <Step title="Select the users you want to assign the app to and click Assign">
    <img src="/images/development/guides/auth-and-provision/okta/select-users.webp" alt="Okta user assignment dialog for selecting users to grant SAML app access" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Head over to the Sign On tab and click on the 'view SAML setup instructions' button">
    <img src="/images/development/guides/auth-and-provision/okta/view-saml-instructions.webp" alt="Okta Sign On tab with the View SAML setup instructions button" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Scroll to the bottom and copy the IDP metadata">
    <img src="/images/development/guides/auth-and-provision/okta/idp-metadata.webp" alt="Okta SAML setup instructions page showing the IDP metadata XML to copy" />
  </Step>
  <Step title="Copy the IDP metadata and paste it in the `connection.xml` file in the `formbricks/saml-connection` (use `formbricks/apps/web/saml-connection` for development) directory" />
</Steps>

That's it. Now when you try to login with SSO, your application on Okta will handle the authentication.

## Environment Variables

The following environment variable is required to enable SAML SSO in Formbricks:

| Variable | Type | Default | Description |
|----------|------|---------|-------------|
| `SAML_DATABASE_URL` | `string` (optional) | — | Dedicated PostgreSQL connection string for SAML/Jackson data (e.g., `postgresql://postgres:postgres@localhost:5432/formbricks-saml`). Enables SAML SSO when set. |

<Note>
  The following SAML-related values are **hardcoded constants** in the Formbricks codebase and are **not configurable** via environment variables:

  - `SAML_AUDIENCE`: Hardcoded to `https://saml.formbricks.com` (Source: `apps/web/lib/constants.ts`)
  - `SAML_PATH`: Hardcoded to `/api/auth/saml/callback` (Source: `apps/web/lib/constants.ts`)
  - `SAML_TENANT`: Hardcoded to `formbricks.com` (Source: `apps/web/lib/constants.ts`)
  - `SAML_PRODUCT`: Hardcoded to `formbricks` (Source: `apps/web/lib/constants.ts`)
  - `SAML_XML_DIR`: Hardcoded to `./saml-connection` (or `apps/web/saml-connection` for development) (Source: `apps/web/lib/constants.ts`)
</Note>

## Technical Details

Formbricks integrates SAML SSO using the `@boxyhq/saml-jackson` library (version **1.52.2**). Below are the key technical details of the integration:

- **Library**: `@boxyhq/saml-jackson` v1.52.2 (Source: `apps/web/package.json`)
- **Initialization**: Jackson is initialized in `apps/web/modules/ee/auth/saml/lib/jackson.ts` as a server-side module
- **License Gate**: The SAML feature is gated behind `getIsSamlSsoEnabled()` (Source: `apps/web/modules/ee/license-check/lib/utils.ts`)
- **Database**: Uses a **dedicated PostgreSQL database** configured via `SAML_DATABASE_URL`, separate from the main Formbricks database
- **Connection Preloading**: XML metadata is read from the `saml-connection` directory at startup (Source: `apps/web/modules/ee/auth/saml/lib/preload-connection.ts`)
- **API Routes**: The SAML authentication flow uses four API endpoints:
  - `authorize` — initiates SAML authentication
  - `callback` — handles the SAML assertion response
  - `token` — exchanges authorization code for a token
  - `userinfo` — retrieves user profile information

  (Source: `apps/web/modules/ee/auth/saml/api/` directory)
