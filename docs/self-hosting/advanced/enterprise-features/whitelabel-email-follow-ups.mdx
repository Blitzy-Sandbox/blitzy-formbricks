With the Enterprise Edition, you can customize the [Follow-up Emails](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/email-customization) sent to respondents. White-label email follow-ups allow you to fully customize the branding of transactional emails sent to survey respondents, creating a seamless branded experience for your users. Instead of seeing default Formbricks branding, respondents see your organization's identity in every email they receive.

## Customization Options

The white-label email customization settings are managed at the organization level. Only users with the **Owner** or **Manager** role can modify these settings.

The following branding options are available:

- **Custom Logo** — Upload your organization's logo to appear in follow-up emails. Supported file formats include JPEG, PNG, and WebP. Logos must be 5 MB or less. Navigate to **Organization Settings → Email Customization** to upload your logo.
- **Send Test Email** — After uploading your logo, use the **Send test email** button to preview how the branded email appears to respondents before sending live follow-ups.
- **Remove Logo** — Reset the email logo back to the default Formbricks branding at any time.

For details on the overall email customization capabilities including template structure and the logo upload process, see the [Email Customization Guide](/xm-and-surveys/core-features/email-customization).

## Branding Scope

White-label email customization applies selectively based on the type of email being sent.

**Customized (White-Labeled):**

- Follow-up emails sent to survey respondents
- Email notifications triggered by survey responses
- Transactional emails related to survey activity

**Not Customized (Remains Formbricks-Branded):**

- Internal team emails (e.g., invitations to join a Formbricks team)
- Organization management emails (e.g., membership invitations)
- System notification emails to organization members

<Note>Emails sent to the coworkers of your organisation (e.g. invitations to join a Formbricks team) remain Formbricks branded.</Note>
